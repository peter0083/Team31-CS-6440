          "briefSummary": "This study is exploring the use of Panitumumab in Head and Neck Cancer. Panitumumab is an approved drug named Vectibix and is used as an anti-cancer agent in other cancers such as colorectal cancer. It works by attaching to the cancer cell in a unique way that allows the drug to get into the cancer tissue. In addition to the Panitumumab, participants will also receive a Panitumumab-IRDye800 (Pan800) or a fluorescently labeled Panitumumab infusion. IRDye800 is an investigational dye that, when tested in the lab, helps various characteristics of human tissue show up better when using a special camera during surgery. Panitumumab-IRDye800 is a combination of the drug and the dye that attaches to cancer cells and appears to make them visible to the doctor when he or she uses the special camera during surgery.\n\nThe goal of this study is to use a novel and possibly safer approach to identify an optimal dose for panitumumab to treat cancer patients by using a new light-based therapy. In this study, different drug levels will be analyzed using this approach to understand how much drug reaches the tumor at different administered doses, which may help us provide safer and/or more effective therapies in the future.\n\nThe goal is to identify the correct amount or dose of a drug that is needed for effective cancer therapies. Often, clinical studies look at how much of the drug can be tolerated before patients become sick, rather than how much of the drug is required to be effective.\n\nIRDye800 is an investigational dye that, when tested in the lab, helps various characteristics of human tissue show up better when using a special camera during surgery. Panitumumab-IRDye800 is a combination of the drug and the dye that attaches to cancer cells and appears to make them visible to the doctor when he or she uses the special camera during surgery. This will help the surgeon with clinical margins during surgery and will may have a clearer way to differentiate between cancer and healthy tissue.",
          "detailedDescription": "The primary objective of this study is to understand biologic dosing of panitumumab which would contribute to the field by establishing new methodology for dose selection with the aim of reducing toxicity in cancer patients. For the individual patient in this trial, panitumumab itself is unlikely to demonstrate anti-tumor efficacy. However, previous studies have shown some benefit when using panitumumab-IRDye800 (pan800) as an imaging agent intraoperatively. The investigators hope to improve patient outcomes by gathering clinical data to support pan800 as a tool for reducing positive surgical margins and to identify malignant lymph nodes during surgical resection.\n\nThe drug being used in this study, panitumumab, is approved by the US FDA for treatment of certain types of advanced colorectal cancer at a dosage of 6 mg/kg given every 14 days. Many of the reported adverse events are associated with repeat administration of panitumumab, rather than 1-2 doses being administered in this study. However, the investigators do anticipate some adverse events at therapeutic dosing (anticipated grade 1-2). The most common side effects patients have experienced when receiving panitumumab primarily include skin reactions (including acne like rash, dry or itchy skin, cracking of skin around the participants nail beds, skin infections, and dry eyes), fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea.\n\nCurrently, there is no standardized method to identify the optimal biologic dose (OBD) for oncology therapies. Traditionally, dosing has been based on toxicity levels, specifically the maximally tolerated dose (MTD), rather than actual therapeutic effectiveness. In early-stage oncology trials, MTD often guides dose selection, with plasma drug concentrations serving as a rough measure for dose optimization. However, this plasma provides limited insight into how much of the drug actually reaches the tumor or binds to the intended target.\n\nThis study proposes a novel approach to finding OBD by measuring tumor drug concentration in head and neck cancer patients using an optically labeled antibody therapy. The investigators hypothesize that if a drug reaches a maximum concentration at a lower dose that previously thought, there may be no utility in increasing systemic dosing and risk unnecessary toxicity as well as financial burden.\n\nOur group has previously published data using a fluorescent labeled therapeutic antibody (panitumumab-IRDye800) to show heterogenous distribution of antibody within a patient tumor in head and neck cancer. These studies used a single standard dose of panitumumab-IRDye800 which was shown to localize to malignant tumor tissue with minimal adverse events. In this proposed clinical trial, investigators will leverage this previously used fluorescent drug to investigate tumor concentration at multiple dose points up to and including the current FDA approved therapeutic dose to investigate our primary objective. Investigators will similarly use intraoperative fluorescence to assess the ability of the labeled antibody to distinguish malignant vs benign tissue at a range of doses. This intraoperative use has the potential to help optimize surgical margins and identification of malignant lymph nodes in addition to our primary objective of dose selection.\n\nThe main aim of this study is to investigate tumor concentration of fluorescently-labeled panitumumab at multiple doses up to the current FDA-approved therapeutic dose of panitumumab. This will allow us to identify if tumor saturation with this agent occurs below the currently approved dose. For other molecularly-targeted agents, there is evidence that lower doses can provide similar therapeutic benefit to approved doses. For panitumumab, over 30% of patients receiving this agent receive dose reductions due to adverse effects, resulting in a significant proportion of patients receiving a dose that is below the approved level. However, it is unclear if patients receiving this reduced dose achieve tumor saturation and similar therapeutic benefit. In this study, researchers will investigate if tumor saturation plateaus at a lower dose - an objective in line with dose optimization guidelines from the FDA. Our group has previously published data using fluorescently-labeled panitumumab to show heterogenous distribution of antibody within a patient tumor in head and neck cancer. Data from our previous and current work have allowed us to elucidate the relationship between fluorescence and intratumoral antibody concentration. An additional aim of this study is to provide further data on the efficacy of fluorescently-labelled panitumumab in identifying cancer relative to surrounding normal tissue. Improved tumor localization of the fluorescent agent could facilitate improved margin resections in the operating room."

As part of the treatment for lung or esophageal cancer, patients will undergo radiation therapy. Sometimes, during this treatment, the heart is also subjected to some radiation which could affect its function, either increasing or decreasing the function. It is not known the consequences of this change nor is it known if doctors can detect the changes associated with the radiation. Sarcoidosis FDG positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) scans are a common way to image cardiac inflammation and myocardial viability. This study may help doctors image the heart before, during and after radiotherapy to monitor any changes.",

To characterize radiation-related functional imaging changes in the heart using sarcoidosis fludeoxyglucose F-18 (FDG) PET-CT imaging.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. 1. To evaluate the ability of imaging changes in the heart to predict for overall survival (OS).\n\nII. To evaluate the ability of imaging changes in the heart to predict for cardiac toxicity.\n\nIII. To evaluate the ability of imaging changes in the heart to predict for cardiac related death.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate radiation treatment planning strategies to reduce risk of cardiotoxicity.\n\nII. To determine the correlation between sarcoidosis FDG PET-CT scans and oncologic FDG PET-CT scans.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo sarcoidosis FDG PET-CT of the heart before, during and, after radiotherapy.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 12 and 24 months."

          "briefSummary": "This early phase I trial studies the side effects and feasibility of total body irradiation using intensity modulation radiation therapy (IMRT) when given in combination with cyclophosphamide prior to stem cell transplant to treat severe systemic sclerosis. IMRT delivers total body radiation therapy more precisely and may reduce radiation exposure to sensitive normal organs. Giving chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, and total body irradiation before a donor stem cell transplant helps kill cancer cells in the body and helps make room in the bone marrow for new blood-forming cells (stem cells) to grow. Giving IMRT and cyclophosphamide prior to stem cell transplant may work better in treating severe systemic sclerosis and reduce radiation doses to lung and kidneys compared to cyclophosphamide alone.",
          "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the feasibility of using IMRT to deliver total body irradiation (TBI) to 800 cGy while keeping mean lung and kidney doses to 200 cGy.\n\nII. To assess the safety/feasibility of total body irradiation using IMRT (IMRT TBI) in systemic sclerosis patients undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate dose homogeneity and dose sparing to lung and kidneys. II. To evaluate transplant-related mortality at 30 days and 100 days post IMRT TBI.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo TBI using IMRT twice daily (BID) on days -5 and -4 in the absence of disease progression or disease progression. Patients then receive cyclophosphamide on days -3 and -2 and undergo HSCT on day 0 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up on days 30 and 100."
