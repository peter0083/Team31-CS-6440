          "briefSummary": "The purpose of this research study is to see if lifestyle changes can protect memory and thinking (cognition) as we age. A recent study in Finland found that a combination of physical and cognitive exercise, diet, and social activity protected cognitive function in healthy older adults who were at increased risk of significant memory loss. So far no medications can rival this positive outcome. The point of POINTER is to test if lifestyle change can also protect against memory loss in Americans.",
          "detailedDescription": "Lifestyle interventions focused on combining healthy diet, physical activity, and social and intellectual challenges may represent a promising therapeutic strategy to protect brain health. The recent results of the population-based 2-year clinical trial, Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER), indicated that a multidomain intervention of physical activity, nutritional guidance, cognitive training, social activities, and management of heart health risk factors protected cognitive function in healthy older adults at increased risk of cognitive decline. As yet, there are no pharmacological treatment options that can rival this effect. Thus, there is an urgent need to expand this work to test the generalizability, adaptability and sustainability of its findings in diverse and global populations. This pivotal U.S. Study to Protect Brain Health through Lifestyle Intervention to Reduce Risk (U.S. POINTER) will test whether a similar 2-year intensive lifestyle intervention, adapted to American culture and delivered within the community, can protect cognitive function in older adults in the U.S. who are at increased risk for cognitive decline and dementia. If successful, the results of this study will have large-scale implications for public policy regarding standard of clinical care and prescriptive practices for a fast-growing and vulnerable population of older adults."

          "briefSummary": "Efforts to find treatments for AD have yielded only modest benefits, likely because longstanding AD pathological processes induce irreversible neurological compromise. These processes begin years before the onset of clinical symptoms. This possibility has been incorporated into a model describing stages of AD development, articulated by the NIA/Alzheimer's Association preclinical workgroup of which the Co-Director of the Kulynych Alzheimer's Research Center, Dr. Suzanne Craft, was a member. According to this model, the best hope for countermanding the effects of AD lies in intervening at the earliest possible point in the pathological cascade. There are several important ongoing efforts in adults with preclinical AD that directly target amyloid aggregation. Although this strategy addresses an important aspect of the AD pathological cascade, we believe that addressing metabolic dysfunction affecting glucose and insulin regulation offers a complementary approach, in that it may reduce amyloid burden and toxicity, while also directly enhancing synaptic health, brain metabolism, tau regulation and neurovascular function.\n\nThe purpose of the ADCC is to identify and characterize early risk factors that predict cognitive decline and dementia in asymptomatic adults and adults with early signs of cognitive impairment. The data obtained from this study, collected at enrollment and follow-up will allow us to examine disease trajectory in individuals with and without prediabetes and other measures of glucoregulatory dysfunction in this process. The enrollees, who will be well-characterized with regard to cognitive and metabolic status through ADCC assessments, will provide an important resource for other local (institution) and national investigations. Data collected from participants enrolled in the ADCC will be stored indefinitely for future investigations.",
          "detailedDescription": "The data and specimen repository of the ADCC study will provide a unified mechanism for cataloging and storing data that can be efficiently shared across studies. This repository will also allow for important collaborations with other Alzheimer's Disease Centers across the US that are performing similar investigations of adults at increased risk of dementia. Data sharing across multiple institutions and investigators will be critical to optimize speed of acquisition and standardization of outcomes that may ultimately lead to the development of innovative tools for early detection and new treatment strategies. The repository will include cognitive data, human specimen samples (blood, cerebrospinal fluid), medical and family history information, and neuroimaging data. Data collected from participants enrolled in the ADCC will be stored indefinitely for future investigations.\n\nParticipants will include adults at least 55 years old, with or without a cognitive deficit, who meet criteria for inclusion into one of the groups described below. Males and females will be equal to distribution in the Triad area population. Additional recruitment efforts targeting underserved communities will be used to increase representation of these adults in the study cohort beyond what is typical in other local and national studies of AD.\n\nEligible participants will have the option to participate in the core ADCC study and also in a biomarker-intensive substudy that will collect additional measurements of brain function and chemical markers of AD pathology. While all participants enrolled in the core ADCC study will receive brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Those enrolled in the substudy will complete a lumbar puncture (LP) to permit quantification of AD biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Participants enrolled in the substudy will be referred to as the Biomarker-Intensive Group, or ADCC-BIG.\n\nAt study entry, participants will meet inclusion criteria for membership in one of the groups that differ according to cognitive status and metabolic health (described below). Once enrolled, a change in cognitive or metabolic status will not affect eligibility to receive follow-up assessments as part of this study, although frequency of assessment may change (i.e., enrollees who progress to late-stage AD or type 2 diabetes will not be dis-enrolled). Eligible participants who choose to also enroll in ADCC-BIG must agree to complete the LP. If participants have screened or participated in another Kulynych Center study within the last 3 months, some data may be reused to avoid redundant data collection and reduce participant burden. This data may include specimen samples such as blood or CSF, cognitive testing data and MRI imaging data."

Record patients' cognitive outcomes after whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) for hematologic malignancies using standard-of-care neurocognitive function testing.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Assess patients' quality-of-life after WBRT for hematologic malignancies, based on a validated questionnaire.\n\nII. Explore magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes in the brain after WBRT for hematologic malignancies, based on standard-of-care imaging studies.\n\nIII. Study the role of Memantine in patients' cognitive outcomes during and after WBRT for hematologic malignancies, based on standard-of-care use, utilizing standard-of-care neurocognitive function testing.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo neurocognitive function assessments, complete questionnaires over 8-10 minutes and undergo standard of care MRI at baseline (within 4 weeks before the first day of WBRT), 2, 6, 12 months after RT completion, then annually for 5 years."
