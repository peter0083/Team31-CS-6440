Approximately 300 participants will be randomized at a ratio of 2:1 to either the teplizumab group or the placebo group.\n\nTeplizumab or matching placebo will be administered in two courses 6 months apart. Each course of treatment will include daily infusions for 12 days. The total study duration for each participant will be up to 86 weeks.\n\nThe primary objective is to determine whether two courses of teplizumab administered 6 months apart slows the loss of β cells and preserves β cell function over 18 months (78 weeks) in children and adolescents 8-17 years old who have been diagnosed with T1D in the previous 6 weeks.\n\nThe secondary objectives are to evaluate improvements in key clinical parameters of diabetes management, to determine the safety and tolerability of teplizumab, and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity of teplizumab"

This trial will assess detailed renal mechanistic evaluations, with direct measurement of GFR, to understand the important physiologic impacts of SGLT2 inhibition on the early onset manifestations and progression of diabetes complications within this age group.\n\nFundamentally, the ATTEMPT trial will provide essential information in establishing a framework for this young cohort to evaluate key physiologic, mechanistic and metabolic outcomes."

The study has recruited volunteers, who are at high risk of developing diabetes, at twenty-five medical centers in the United States. It is sponsored by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of Health, and other Institute and corporate sponsors. Researchers will evaluate the efficacy of a lifestyle intervention and a pharmacological intervention in preventing or delaying Type 2 diabetes in persons with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Each person in the study will be followed for 3 to 6 years."
