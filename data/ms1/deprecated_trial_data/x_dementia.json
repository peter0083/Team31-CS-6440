Record patients' cognitive outcomes after whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) for hematologic malignancies using standard-of-care neurocognitive function testing.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Assess patients' quality-of-life after WBRT for hematologic malignancies, based on a validated questionnaire.\n\nII. Explore magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes in the brain after WBRT for hematologic malignancies, based on standard-of-care imaging studies.\n\nIII. Study the role of Memantine in patients' cognitive outcomes during and after WBRT for hematologic malignancies, based on standard-of-care use, utilizing standard-of-care neurocognitive function testing.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo neurocognitive function assessments, complete questionnaires over 8-10 minutes and undergo standard of care MRI at baseline (within 4 weeks before the first day of WBRT), 2, 6, 12 months after RT completion, then annually for 5 years."

          "briefSummary": "Persistent developmental stuttering affects more than three million people in the United States, and it can have profound adverse effects on quality of life. Despite its prevalence and negative impact, stuttering has resisted explanation and effective treatment, due in large part to a poor understanding of the neural processing impairments underlying the disorder. The overall goal of this study is to improve understanding of the brain mechanisms involved in speech motor planning and how these are disrupted in neurogenic speech disorders, like stuttering. The investigators will do this through an integrated combination of experiments that involve speech production, functional MRI, and non-invasive brain stimulation. The study is designed to test hypotheses regarding the brain processes involved in learning and initiating new speech sound sequences and how those processes compare in persons with persistent developmental stuttering and those with typical speech development. These processes will be studied in both adults and children. Additionally, these processes will be investigated in patients with neurodegenerative speech disorders (primary progressive aphasia) to further inform the investigators understanding of the neural mechanisms that support speech motor sequence learning. Together these experiments will result in an improved account of the brain mechanisms underlying speech production in fluent speakers and individuals who stutter, thereby paving the way for the development of new therapies and technologies for addressing this disorder."

          "briefSummary": "The study is designed to determine the relationship between structural and functional changes in the brain on imaging and progression of speech and language, neurological and neuropsychological features in patients with neurodegenerative apraxia of speech (AOS).",
          "detailedDescription": "Apraxia of Speech (AOS) is a disorder of speech motor planning and/or programming that affects the production of speech, characterized by slow speaking rate, abnormal prosody and distorted sound substitutions, additions, repetitions and prolongations, sometimes accompanied by groping, and trial and error articulatory movements. While AOS is commonly associated with vascular insults, it can be the predominant manifestation of neurodegenerative disease. Apraxia of speech can be the only manifestation of a neurodegenerative disorder. However, AOS very often co-occurs with aphasia, particularly a non-fluent aphasia (NFA) of the Broca's type; a language disorder, typically characterized by agrammatic, telegraphic or truncated spoken language, often accompanied by similar difficulties with written language. Patients with neurodegenerative AOS can have varying degrees of NFA, with the aphasia considered more severe than the AOS in some patients, but with the AOS dominant in others. It is extremely rare to have a patient that presents with NFA that does not also have AOS. Patients with isolated AOS can develop NFA over time, although in some patients the AOS remains isolated for as many as 8-10 years.\n\nPatients with AOS can also develop dysarthria and other non-speech motor symptoms, such as extrapyramidal features, postural instability, extra ocular eye movement abnormalities and limb apraxia. Cognitive impairment can also develop, although is rarely an early feature of the disease. The syndrome is progressive with many patients eventually becoming mute.\n\nStudies have shown that patients with neurodegenerative AOS can be pathologically heterogeneous, with some cases showing deposition of the microtubule associated protein tau, while others have deposition of the TAR DNA binding protein of 43kDa (TDP-43). Typical tau pathologies that are observed include corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and Pick's disease. Clinical features are currently unhelpful in predicting the underlying pathology in these cases, although there is a suggestion that cases with isolated or dominant AOS may be more likely to show tau pathology, particularly PSP.\n\nThis project will be the first to assess longitudinal multi-modality neuroimaging in subjects with neurodegenerative AOS. It will allow us to assess all aspects of disease progression in these subjects, including changes on neuroimaging, speech and language, neurological, and neuropsychological assessments, to get a complete picture of dysfunction and progression in these subjects. This project will also be the first to apply DTI and the recently developed technique of resting state fMRI to the study of this disease. These techniques are of great current interest to the field and provide, for the first time, a way of assessing underlying functional and structural connectivity across the brain. Both techniques provide important information about how disease progresses through the brain tissue and have huge potential to be important future biomarkers of many different neurodegenerative diseases."

          "briefSummary": "Efforts to find treatments for AD have yielded only modest benefits, likely because longstanding AD pathological processes induce irreversible neurological compromise. These processes begin years before the onset of clinical symptoms. This possibility has been incorporated into a model describing stages of AD development, articulated by the NIA/Alzheimer's Association preclinical workgroup of which the Co-Director of the Kulynych Alzheimer's Research Center, Dr. Suzanne Craft, was a member. According to this model, the best hope for countermanding the effects of AD lies in intervening at the earliest possible point in the pathological cascade. There are several important ongoing efforts in adults with preclinical AD that directly target amyloid aggregation. Although this strategy addresses an important aspect of the AD pathological cascade, we believe that addressing metabolic dysfunction affecting glucose and insulin regulation offers a complementary approach, in that it may reduce amyloid burden and toxicity, while also directly enhancing synaptic health, brain metabolism, tau regulation and neurovascular function.\n\nThe purpose of the ADCC is to identify and characterize early risk factors that predict cognitive decline and dementia in asymptomatic adults and adults with early signs of cognitive impairment. The data obtained from this study, collected at enrollment and follow-up will allow us to examine disease trajectory in individuals with and without prediabetes and other measures of glucoregulatory dysfunction in this process. The enrollees, who will be well-characterized with regard to cognitive and metabolic status through ADCC assessments, will provide an important resource for other local (institution) and national investigations. Data collected from participants enrolled in the ADCC will be stored indefinitely for future investigations.",
          "detailedDescription": "The data and specimen repository of the ADCC study will provide a unified mechanism for cataloging and storing data that can be efficiently shared across studies. This repository will also allow for important collaborations with other Alzheimer's Disease Centers across the US that are performing similar investigations of adults at increased risk of dementia. Data sharing across multiple institutions and investigators will be critical to optimize speed of acquisition and standardization of outcomes that may ultimately lead to the development of innovative tools for early detection and new treatment strategies. The repository will include cognitive data, human specimen samples (blood, cerebrospinal fluid), medical and family history information, and neuroimaging data. Data collected from participants enrolled in the ADCC will be stored indefinitely for future investigations.\n\nParticipants will include adults at least 55 years old, with or without a cognitive deficit, who meet criteria for inclusion into one of the groups described below. Males and females will be equal to distribution in the Triad area population. Additional recruitment efforts targeting underserved communities will be used to increase representation of these adults in the study cohort beyond what is typical in other local and national studies of AD.\n\nEligible participants will have the option to participate in the core ADCC study and also in a biomarker-intensive substudy that will collect additional measurements of brain function and chemical markers of AD pathology. While all participants enrolled in the core ADCC study will receive brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Those enrolled in the substudy will complete a lumbar puncture (LP) to permit quantification of AD biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Participants enrolled in the substudy will be referred to as the Biomarker-Intensive Group, or ADCC-BIG.\n\nAt study entry, participants will meet inclusion criteria for membership in one of the groups that differ according to cognitive status and metabolic health (described below). Once enrolled, a change in cognitive or metabolic status will not affect eligibility to receive follow-up assessments as part of this study, although frequency of assessment may change (i.e., enrollees who progress to late-stage AD or type 2 diabetes will not be dis-enrolled). Eligible participants who choose to also enroll in ADCC-BIG must agree to complete the LP. If participants have screened or participated in another Kulynych Center study within the last 3 months, some data may be reused to avoid redundant data collection and reduce participant burden. This data may include specimen samples such as blood or CSF, cognitive testing data and MRI imaging data."

          "briefSummary": "Over the next 30 years, more than 10 million persons living with dementia in the United States will receive care at home from an unpaid and untrained family caregiver. At home care is preferred by caregivers and persons with dementia alike, but increases the caregiver's risk of insomnia and related negative health outcomes, including depression, anxiety, cognitive disturbances and poor quality of life. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is a highly effective and established evidence based treatment for adults of all ages. Although relatively understudied in dementia caregivers, the research by our group and others suggests CBT-I is also efficacious in caregivers. Our team developed a brief (4 session) CBT-I protocol specifically adapted for dementia caregivers (CBT-I) and has shown in person and remote (i.e. telehealth) delivery of this protocol significantly reduces insomnia symptoms and improves mood (moderate to large effects). Given demands on caregivers' time and limited availability of trained CBT-I providers, a web-based version of CBT-I (WebCBT-I; the online treatment will be called NiteCAPP) is needed to increase the accessibility of this efficacious treatment. WebCBT-I will allow for flexible at home scheduling, and the skills needed to monitor caregiver treatment progress can be quickly and efficiently taught to healthcare providers. The overarching goal of this project is to develop and test WebCBT-I in caregivers of persons with dementia.\n\nObjectives\n\n1. To examine the clinical and health characteristics, including sleep, pain, fatigue, cognitive abilities, and cardiovascular health in dementia caregivers with insomnia.\n2. To examine changes in the primary clinical outcomes, including complaints of poor sleep, and fatigue.\n3. To examine changes in the secondary clinical outcomes, including mood, daytime functioning, cognitive functioning, and cardiovascular health.\n4. To examine the mechanistic variables, including arousal (heart rate variability, HRV)."

          "briefSummary": "The goal of this pilot study is to test a combination of two non-invasive brain stimulation methods, called iTBS (intermittent theta burst stimulation) and tDCS (transcranial direct current stimulation), in people with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). This study will also explore whether the combined treatment shows promise for reducing neuropsychiatric symptoms like mood swings, apathy, and agitation, and will evaluate the impact of the treatment on caregivers.\n\nThe main questions the study aims to answer are:\n\n1. Is the combined brain stimulation treatment practical and well-tolerated?\n2. Do preliminary results suggest that this treatment could help manage neuropsychiatric symptoms and support a larger study?\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* Attend nine in-person visits over three months.\n* Complete one week of in-clinic brain stimulation sessions (iTBS) followed by four weeks of daily at-home brain stimulation sessions (tDCS).\n* Take part in brain scans, questionnaires, and brain activity tests before and after the treatment.\n\nThis pilot study is a first step to assess whether this combined treatment approach is practical and whether it has potential to improve symptoms, laying the groundwork for larger studies in the future.",
          "detailedDescription": "This study is designed to explore a new way to manage behavioral and emotional symptoms in people with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). Many people with these conditions experience mood swings, apathy, or agitation, which can be difficult to treat with current medications due to limited effectiveness and side effects. This research is testing whether two types of brain stimulation, called iTBS (intermittent theta burst stimulation) and tDCS (transcranial direct current stimulation), can be combined to provide a non-invasive and potentially effective treatment for these symptoms.\n\nBrain stimulation is already used in other areas of medicine and involves applying gentle magnetic or electrical stimulation to the brain. iTBS uses short bursts of magnetic pulses, while tDCS uses a low electrical current. Both methods are painless, safe, and do not require surgery. This study is the first to look at combining these two techniques for people with AD/ADRD, based on findings from other research that suggest the combination might have stronger effects than either method alone.\n\nSince this is a pilot study, the focus is on understanding whether the treatment process is practical for both patients and caregivers. This includes evaluating how easy it is for participants to attend the clinic sessions, whether caregivers can successfully administer the at-home treatments, and whether the overall process is manageable for families. In addition to these practical questions, researchers will also collect preliminary data to see if the treatment helps improve behavioral symptoms and measure any changes in the brain using scans and brain activity tests.\n\nParticipants will spend one week receiving treatments in a clinic and four weeks using a portable device for at-home sessions. Researchers will closely monitor participants throughout the study to ensure safety and will follow up to see if any improvements last after the treatment ends.\n\nThe study is an important step in understanding whether this new approach has potential to help people with AD/ADRD and whether it should be studied further in larger trials. It also aims to identify how to make the treatment process as smooth and effective as possible for patients and caregivers."

The study combines two techniques: intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). The process begins with in-clinic iTBS sessions to \"prime\" the brain, potentially enhancing its plasticity and receptiveness to subsequent treatments. This is followed by four weeks of at-home tDCS sessions, administered with caregiver assistance. The sequential use of these treatment methods is based on research suggesting that combining techniques may amplify therapeutic effects. The study aims to evaluate both the feasibility of this approach and its potential effects on symptoms and brain function, providing insights for future larger clinical trials.",

The sequential design leverages different mechanisms of action: iTBS delivers magnetic pulses to targeted brain areas to modulate neural activity, while tDCS applies a low electrical current for sustained modulation. This approach specifically targets neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g., mood swings, apathy, and agitation) in individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (ADRD), a population often underserved by traditional interventions.

Following informed consent, participants will undergo semi-structured interviews assessing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and updated lifetime TBI history, neurological examination, neuropsychological testing, structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) T1, T2, fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), diffuse tensor imaging (DTI), as well as novel imaging techniques to assess imaging biomarkers of traumatic cerebrovascular injury (TCVI): 1) functional MRI (fMRI)-Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) with hypercapnia challenge to measure cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR); and 2) Dynamic Contrast Enhanced-MRI to assess blood brain barrier integrity, and an additional research blood draw \\[apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype; plasma biomarkers including vascular (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor, von Willebrand Factor, cholesterol, homocysteine), inflammatory (e.g., high sensitivity c-reactive protein, interleukin-6 (IL-6), chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40)), and neuronal degeneration (e.g., neurofilament light, phosphorylated tau, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, beta amyloid proteins)\\]. A medical record review will be conducted specifically for current and past history of cerebrovascular risk factors (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, tobacco use) and psychological conditions (e.g., PTSD, depression). The project will also leverage previously collected data, comparing participants' symptoms, cognitive performance, imaging, and, blood biomarkers to those previously collected through the NICoE, 15-Year study and/or the DOD serum repository, with data from at least two time points on all individuals."

          "briefSummary": "This study investigates the relationship between the noradrenergic (NA) system, sleep quality, and cognitive function in older adults with insomnia - a population at elevated risk for Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (ADRD) - compared to age and sex matched controls with normal sleep. The study characterizes NA function through multiple approaches: measuring 24-hour plasma levels of norepinephrine (NE) and its brain metabolite 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG); evaluating central NA system response using the clonidine suppression test (a presynaptic \u03b12 adrenoreceptor agonist that reduces locus coeruleus NA activity; and employing pupillometry as a non-invasive marker of autonomic function. To explore NA function's mechanistic role in insomnia, the study uses an intervention with bright light exposure to enhance daytime NA activity, with the goal of improving both sleep quality and cognitive performance."

          "briefSummary": "By age 45, women's lifetime risk of dementia is estimated to be 1 in 5. Two-thirds of people currently living with a dementia diagnosis are women, and-women make up the majority of carers for people with dementia. Because women bear a larger burden of the dementia epidemic, they tend to be more fearful about dementia compared to men. Women may be especially fearful during the menopause transition, which can impact cognition. These fears can cause significant psychological distress, functional impairment, and avoidance of help seeking. Interventions that acknowledge women's fears and promote adaptive coping during the menopause transition are needed to combat dementia-related fear and its negative impacts.\n\nThis project aims to develop, and pilot test a brief personalized, psychosocial intervention for middle-aged perimenopausal individuals with elevated dementia risk. The investigators will assess the intervention's acceptability and feasibility for use in this population. The project will be completed in three stages. First, the investigators will conduct focus groups to better understand individual fears about dementia, informational and decisional needs, and strategies to promote adaptive coping as they transition through menopause (case-only, single time point). Second, the investigators will develop an intervention to meet the specific needs identified by the focus groups. Intervention components will address multiple areas of women's health in midlife, including aspects of physical and psychological health, as well as functional health outcomes that have important and long-lasting life implications. Finally, the investigators will conduct pilot testing to assess the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention (cohort, 3-week testing period).\n\nThis project will deliver a novel psychosocial intervention that can provide middle-aged perimenopausal women with the information and practical skills that can help them manage their dementia-related fears and encourage adaptive coping behaviors. Outputs from the project will serve as preliminary data for a fully powered randomized controlled trial."

Psychoeducation in this context will focus on menopausal symptoms like brain fog (e.g., how common they are, how long they typically last), information about dementia and its risk factors (e.g., most actionable risk factors in mid-life), and links between menopause and dementia (e.g., hormonal replacement therapy). Psychological grounding content will focus on practical training exercises in mindful monitoring of concerns about brain fog and other menopausal symptoms (e.g., meditation, deep breathing). Behavioral activation will focus on exercises to recognize and disrupt avoidant coping behaviors, and increase engagement in valued activities (e.g., social engagement, exercise, healthy eating).",

          "briefSummary": "This study is designed to evaluate the impact on the quality of life and wellbeing of a person-centered online dance program on people living with dementia or MCI and care partners.\n\nThe duration of the study will be 1 year. Each participant in the study will be followed for approximately 4 months. The study includes joining a weekly 1-hour dance program online on Zoom for 12 weeks. Prior and after the dance program, participants will meet with the research coordinator to answer some questionnaires about wellbeing and reflections on their experience in the program. After the completion of the dance program, participants will be invited to join a focus group to reflect of the impact of the program with fellow participants.\n\nThe study will enroll up to 72 participants. This includes 36 dyads of persons living with dementia or MCI and their care partners.\n\nThe study will enroll community-dwelling people living with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or mild to moderate-stage dementia and care partners living in the United States.",
          "detailedDescription": "One third of older adults with cognitive impairment in the United States (est. 4.3 million individuals) live alone, which places them at higher levels of precarity and opens them up to the detrimental effects of isolation and stigma. Studies illuminate how the lack of appropriate services to support independent living for people with cognitive impairment influence the precarity that these older adults face, a precarity which has heightened significantly since the COVID-19 pandemic. For the 50 million people living with dementia (PLWD) globally, this lack of meaningful connection is compounded by the detrimental effects of a progressive disease which can impact affective states, mobility and spatial relationship, and ability to communicate or follow conversations. As a result, people living with dementia inevitably experience shifts in their modes and capacities for expression which influence their ability to express and feel connected to the communities around them. Reportedly, persons living with dementia and their care partners often experience a reduction in size of their social networks and loss of connection with others as the disease progresses.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic illustrated the feasibility and benefit of virtual social engagement programs for older adults and PLWD, offering a support network from the comfort of their home. Research into virtually delivered social programs for PLWD suggest implications beyond the context of COVID-19, where virtual models may support the social connectedness of those living in geographically marginalized and underserved areas. Additionally, evaluations of telemedicine programs list preferences among PLWD and care partners citing convenience from resources and time saved, and improved access as benefits to virtual engagement. This suggests that even now after the imposed physical isolation of the pandemic have been lifted, having access to creative social programming virtually will continue to be a lifeline for PLWD.\n\nWith global projections of dementia approaching 82 million people in 2030, the need for supporting and expanding networks of meaningful and stimulating connection for and with people living with dementia is evident. Increasingly, person-centered models of care for people living with dementia are becoming the gold standard globally, highlighting the necessity of creating meaningful relationships to support them. This underlines the demand for programs that engage with people living with dementia as opposed to only delivering programs at or to them. Relationality is key to meaningful citizenship and people living with dementia are not exempt from the right to it not immune to its benefits.\n\nAs highlighted by Dr. Livingston, \"engaging in meaningful and pleasurable activities is hypothesized to improve health and wellbeing\" for people living with dementia. The benefits of these social engagements include reconnecting individuals to their physical and social environment, supporting self- esteem, building neural connections through complex interactions and promoting a sense of role continuity, purpose, or personhood, self-identity, and meaning. Dance as a multi-modal activity which couples multiple cognitive tasks with aerobic exercise and social engagement, is increasingly lauded as a social engagement for older adults and PLWD. Dance, which promotes community engagement coupled with physical fitness, is the highest preferred physical activity among diverse community residing older adults.\n\nA growing body of research illustrates the potential of dance in impacting brain health through: engaging motor control and function on multiple levels, supporting individual and social wellbeing, offsetting depression, and offering ameliorative cognitive effects through aerobic fitness and creative engagement. Additionally, social engagement, positive mood and physical activity are three of 12 modifiable risk factors for dementia, indicating the benefit of this activity across the life course.\n\nThere is a need to extend the positive benefits of dance (including coordination, mood, social connection and creative engagement) to PLWD. The Stories in the Moment (SIM) program engages PLWD through dance, sensory engagement, music and storytelling while centering their participation as co-creative agents. Stories in the Moment provides tools that can help participants maintain meaningful engagement, community and connection regardless of their disease progression. The program uses co-creative dance improvisation practices to help people explore options of expression and gain comfort and security in the broad range of resources available to them in their bodies, minds, and voices. Dance is a universal language which mobilizes our bodies to tell stories in movement. SIM utilizes and extends the benefits of group dance improvisation to connect meaning and movement to build collective \"stories in the moment\". In co- creating these group story-dances, valuing the essential contributions of each participant regardless of their \"ability\", SIM supports connection, communication and the building of creative community with PLWD.\n\nThere exists a paucity of understanding of the impact of dance and creative movement on the wellbeing, sense of belonging and quality of life of people living with dementia.\n\nThis pilot project will deliver a creative dance program, Stories in the Moment, to diverse individuals living with dementia and their care partners residing across the U.S. A delivery of a mixed-methods evaluation of the novel Stories in the Moment program delivered virtually will allow for an informed understanding of the perceived impact of the program for people living with dementia and their care partners and in turn inform the approach to development, further optimization and scalability of this program.\n\nBACKGROUND ON STORIES IN THE MOMENT DANCE PROGRAM The Stories in the Moment program approaches implemented in this research study have been successfully prototyped since 2020 in partnership with local and national organizations and community partners serving diverse communities of people living with dementia and care partners in the United States. The Stories in the Moment program was developed and prototyped in partnership with people living with dementia and their care partners through the Virtual Engagement Program on the Dementia Action Alliance (DAA) (2021). The curriculum and practical approach were informed by the 20-year experience of the PI as a dance artist and builder of community-based dance programs for intergenerational groups and older adults. Leveraging this practical experience with a background in neuropharmacology and a rigorous and systematic review of peer- reviewed literature on the effects of dance on brain health for healthy older adults and PLWD, shaped the Stories in the Moment framework and methodology.\n\nSAMPLE SIZE Up to 36 people living with dementia will be selected to join the study. Up to 36 care partners or collateral (a family member, paid caregiver, or close friend who spends at least 8 hours/week with the person living with dementia and speaks fluent English) who also consent to participate in the study will be included.\n\nRESEARCH LOCATION All research activities for this study will take place online through the Zoom videoconferencing platform. Participants in the virtual dance program will be joining from multiple locations around the United States from their personal devices and most often from their homes or places of residence.\n\nPROCEDURES\n\n1. Prior to the start of the research study, potential participants will meet with the research coordinator to complete a consent interview.\n2. Pre-dance program intervention questionnaires: (a) basic demographic questionnaire, (b) WHO-5 scale of wellbeing adapted for people living with dementia, (c) anxiety (Rating for Anxiety in Dementia-Scheduled Interview designed for evaluators without extensive clinical training) and (d) loneliness (6-item De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale) as well as a (e) qualitative questionnaire evaluating interest and expectations in joining the Stories in the Moment program.\n\n   The questionnaires will be delivered via a conversation with a researcher over the telephone or a videoconferencing platform. The pre-intervention questionnaires will take approximately 20 minutes to complete.\n3. Over the course of three months (12 weeks) of the intervention, study participants will join once a week for an hour on a videoconference call (Zoom) to engage in the dance program, Stories in the Moment for a total of 12 sessions.\n\n   Participants will be assigned to one of up to 3 virtual classes based on their time zone and availability for the duration of the 12-week series. During the Stories in the Moment class session, the activities will alternate between self-created (their own) movements and activities demonstrated by the teaching artist (to follow). All activities will be performed seated and are adjusted to provide best practices in progression of movements for older adults and individuals with limited mobility. As the nature of the program is co-creative, meaning the participants guide the movements selected, participants will be invited, at all times, to participate in a way that feels good to them.\n\n   Researchers will track attendance and de-identified field notes of participant responses and participation as well as teaching artist approaches and adaptations will be documented.\n4. Immediately following the 12-week intervention of Stories in the Moment, study participants (people living with dementia and care partners/a collateral who also consented to participate in the study) will be invited to participate in a focus group. The focus group will last up to an hour on a videoconference (Zoom) platform. Persons living with dementia and care partners/collateral will be asked to describe their experience with the Stories in the Moment program.\n5. Post-dance intervention questionnaires: (a) WHO-5 scale of wellbeing adapted for people living with dementia, (c) anxiety (Rating for Anxiety in Dementia-Scheduled Interview designed for evaluators without extensive clinical training) and (d) loneliness (6-item De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale), (d) belonging (Sense of Belonging Scale) as well as a (e) questionnaire with open ended questions evaluating their perceptions and reflections in joining the Stories in the Moment program. The questionnaires will be delivered via a conversation with a researcher over the telephone or a videoconferencing platform. The post-intervention questionnaires will take approximately 40 minutes to complete.\n\nMagda Kaczmarska is an Atlantic Fellow for Equity in Brain Health at the Global Brain Health Institute (GBHI).

The diagnosis of AD pathology must be confirmed through the 2024 revised NIA-AA Workgroup criteria using a stepwise diagnostic approach.\n* Participants must have an Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score ranging from 12 through 22, inclusive, at the time of screening.\n* Participants must have a designated caregiver who maintains adequate contact (around 10 hours per week or more) and is willing to attend all study visits. The caregiver must also be responsible for reporting on the participant's condition, overseeing medication compliance, and consenting to their involvement in both their own and the participant's study-related activities.\n* Participants on acetyl choline esterase inhibitors (AChEIs) and/or memantine, must have been on a stable dosage for at least 12 weeks prior to screening, and agree to maintain this stable dose for the study duration.\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n* Participants must not present with any significant or severe medical conditions that could compromise their safety, the ability to comply with or complete the study, or the integrity of the study results. This includes any grade of hepatic impairment.\n* Participants must not have any primary psychiatric diagnoses such as major depression, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder, and those with severe psychiatric symptoms that could complicate the interpretation of treatment effects, impair cognitive assessment, or impact study completion.\n* Participants must not have a history of schizophrenia or other chronic psychosis, as well as those who have previously been exposed to KarXT or are currently undergoing treatment with disease-modifying anti-amyloid therapies for AD within the past 6 months prior to screening.\n* Participants must not have significant pathological findings on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at screening that could affect safety or interfere with study procedures.\n* Other protocol-defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria apply.",

The cohort is as follows:\n\n  o Cohort 1: Huntington's Disease (n=5)\n* The study will enroll participants per the eligibility criteria.\n* Participants will have 1 scheduled biospecimen collection visit(s). If the participant requires a recollection or is called for an extra sample donation, this will add additional volume and visit(s) to the collection schedule. The biospecimens collected from participants are whole blood.\n* The target blood volume of each phlebotomy visit will be 20 mL. The minimum accepted volume (in the event of tough venipuncture attempts or difficulty obtaining the blood) will be 5 mL. The maximum amount that can be drawn in a 6-week period will be 100 mL (whole blood 6-week maximum).\n* Confirmation of eligibility and medical record review by a member of the study staff will be completed for participants of the cohort before they are considered fully enrolled."

This project seeks to improve public health by delivering a just-in-time text messaging intervention proximally to drinking episodes and evaluating the impact of the intervention on alcohol-facilitated IPV in a sample of at-risk young adult men and women. Additionally, through an innovative design this project is poised to answer these important questions: whether receiving a message, when, for whom, what type, and under what conditions this just-in-time messaging intervention leads to reductions in alcohol use and IPV perpetration."

          "briefSummary": "Purpose: Conduct a wait-list randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an inclusive physical activity program called PACE for adults with intellectual disability (ID) who are not yet showing signs of Alzheimer's Disease (AD)/age-related dementias (ARD).\n\nParticipants: Participants include 120 adults with ID, their caregivers, and their coaches (up to 360 individual participants, grouped as triads), recruited through the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Arkansas. Participants also include 16 exercise professionals.\n\nProcedures (methods): Each cohort will include 20 triads who are randomly assigned to the PACE program or the waitlist control group.",
          "detailedDescription": "Each potential adult with ID or family who contacts the research team will be called and screened for eligibility in the study. To determine eligibility, screening questions will include asking if the adult participant has a formal diagnosis of ID; report of intellectual ability level will be confirmed with direct cognitive testing during the screening assessment visit using scales completed by the participant and caregiver. Also at the screening visit, caregivers will complete the dementia screener for the participants, and participants will be provided with an Actigraph GT9X Link device so they can complete a weeklong physical activity baseline measure. At the second study visit, participants and caregivers will complete the pre-assessments (described below and attached), and participants will have their body composition measured. Questions to all scorable assessments will be required to prevent missing data. Select demographic information will have an additional \"prefer not to answer\" choice. Participants will complete demographic measures, primary and secondary outcome measures, and feasibility and acceptability measures across the first two study visits. Those who qualify will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (1) initial intervention or (2) waitlist control. Individuals assigned to the waitlist control group will begin the intervention after the initial group completes post-assessments.\n\nThe 16-week intervention includes: (1) a weekly group fitness class for adults with ID, (2) web based training and resources for coaches and exercise professionals; (3) weekly coaching meetings for coaches and adults with ID, and (4) daily/weekly interactions with the PACE interactive web based dashboard for adults with ID.\n\nA post-assessment visit will be conducted to repeat the pre-assessment measures, and a subset of participants and coaches will also complete an interview to answer open-ended questions about their program experiences. A 12-month follow-up visit will also be scheduled to measure body composition again.\n\nBrief description of measures to be completed by Caregivers as follows:\n\nVineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-3: (VABS) (Vineland-3) is a standardized assessment tool that utilizes semi-structured interview to measure adaptive behavior and support the diagnosis of intellectual and developmental disabilities, autism, and developmental delays. Interviews are expected to take 1-2 hours and will take place during the screening visit.\n\nNational Task Group-Early Detection Screen for Dementia: (NTG-EDSD) This measure was adapted from the Dementia Screening Questionnaire for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (DSQIID) and can be used for the early detection screening of those adults with an intellectual disability who are suspected of or may be showing early signs of mild cognitive impairment or dementia. The NTG-EDSD is not an assessment or diagnostic instrument, but an administrative screen that can be used by staff and family caregivers to note functional decline and health problems and record information useful for further assessment. This assessment will take place during the screening visit.\n\nAdd Health Wave 5 Questionnaire: Questions will be used from the Wave 5 Survey including questions on background (biological sex, gender, race/ethnicity), health and health care (co-occurring conditions and medical treatments, illness and physical limitations, and fitness tracking (experiences using fitness tracking devices, current exercise habits). This measure will take place during the pre and post study visits.\n\nWaisman Activities of Daily Living (W-ADL): The W-ADL is a caregiver-report that measures activities of daily living and assesses functioning. It has demonstrated high internal consistency (Cronbach alphas= .88-.94) and reliability over time (Kappas= .92-.93) in adults with ID. This measure will take place during the pre and post study visits.\n\nBrief description of adult with ID measures as follows:\n\nThe Leiter-3: is a widely used nonverbal measure of intelligence and cognitive abilities that is suitable to use for individuals with cognitive delays, speech or hearing problems, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), or traumatic brain injury. The battery subtest scores are converted to a scaled score and the sum of the scaled scores yields a nonverbal intelligence quotient (IQ)/composite score. This assessment will take place during the screening visit.\n\nWorld Health Organization Quality of Life Brief Version Assessment (WHOQoL-BREF and WHO Disabilities Module): The WHOQoL-BREF and WHO Disabilities module is an abbreviated 39-item version of the original WHOQOL tool that has been used in adults with ID. The domain scores will be used to measure the general quality of life (Overall, Health, Physical, Psychological, Social, Environment, and Disabilities Module). This measure will take place during the pre and post study visits.\n\nNIH-Toolbox Cognitive Battery (NIHTB-CB): The NIHTB-CB will measure mental and cognitive functioning. It has been validated in individuals with ID and adults across the spectrum of Alzheimer's disease and age-related cognitive decline. It is an iPad-based assessment of memory, executive function, and crystallized intelligence. This measure will take place during the pre and post study visits.\n\nNIH-Toolbox Emotional Battery: The NIHTB-EB will measure emotional health across several domains: Psychological Well-Being, Social Relationships, Stress and Self-Efficacy, and Negative Affect. This is an iPad-based assessment that will take place during the pre and post study visits.\n\nPhysical Activity Measures: These measures will take place during the pre and post study visits.\n\nGrip strength (NIH Toolbox): This test consists of squeezing the hand dynamometer for a 1-rep max strength assessment.\n\nThe 4-Stage Balance Test: This test consists of four standing positions that are progressively harder to maintain.\n\n30-Second Chair Stand: This test consists of participants getting up from a chair without using their arms. They get up and sit down repeatedly for 30 seconds. Their score is the number of times they can get up from the chair\n\nTimed Up \\& Go (TUG): This test consists of participants getting up from a chair, walking 10 feet across the room around a cone, and sitting back down.\n\n2-Minute Walk Endurance: This test consists of participants walking as fast as they can for two-minutes up and down the hallway of the assessment spaces.\n\nBod Pod: This scan will measure body composition using Air Displacement Plethysmograph (ADP). Participants at the University of North Carolina site will be briefed on the Bod Pod and sit inside for up to 5 minutes. This measure will take place during the pre- and post-study visits, as well as the one-year follow-up visit.\n\nDXA Scan: This scan will measure body composition using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Participants at the University of Arkansas site will be briefed and lay on the DXA scan table for around 15 minutes. This measure will take place during the pre- and post-study visits, as well as the one-year follow-up visit. Participants who are pregnant, think they may be pregnant, or have had unprotected sex in the last 30 days will not receive a DXA scan."

          "detailedDescription": "The investigators will conduct a prospective, single-arm, non-interventional study using the Emerald device to monitor the behavior of individuals enrolled in the parent study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04430517). Investigators aim to enroll approximately 40 individuals aged 18 -89 (inclusive) with either MCI or mild AD who will have Emerald deployed in their home for up to 12 weeks, spanning the time of approval of parent study screening and formal study enrollment. The Emerald device is a radio-wave sensor that uses signal processing and machine learning algorithms to track the gait, movement, respiration, and sleep of subjects without physical contact or effort by the user, i.e. it neither requires the subject to wear a sensor nor record any data. Emerald works by transmitting low-powered radio signals, 1000x less than Wi-Fi, that reflect off of the subject and return back to the device. If the user moves their arm or leg, or their chest expands and contracts from breathing, that movement changes how the signal reflects off of their body. Emerald records these reflections and processes them using algorithms that convert the radio signals into movement data, breathing rate, sleep stages (Awake, Light, Deep and REM), and key sleep parameters. The device will be deployed in the bedroom of each subject to capture behavior continuously."

If eligible for the study, subjects will be randomized to receive one of the conditions for 24 weeks.\n\nThe current study will test the hypothesis that a moderate dose of CBD will improve measures of Alzheimer's disease progression, cognitive function, pain, sleep quality, anxiety, oxidative stress, and inflammation as compared to placebo. The study will also test whether endocannabinoids mediate the effects of CBD on these outcomes."

          "briefSummary": "Cognitive impairment after moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (msTBI) not only significantly affects the quality of life in individuals with msTBI, but also increases the possibility of late-life dementia. The goal of this study is to determine whether acute (\\< 1 week) cerebrovascular injury and its recovery within the first year postinjury measured by cerebral autoregulation and brain perfusion are associated with cognitive outcome at 12 months after msTBI. The results from this study will improve our understanding of cerebrovascular contributions to cognitive decline related to TBI and provide critical data to inform the development of strategies based on vascular mechanisms to improve cognition and prevent neurodegeneration after msTBI.",
          "detailedDescription": "Nonfatal traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of disability in adults, with an estimated economic cost of approximately $40.6 billion for the US population. The quality of life of TBI survivors is highly dependent on the extent of cognitive recovery after injury. Of note, about 65% of moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (msTBI) survivors continue to experience cognitive symptoms including impaired memory, slow processing speed, and poor attention span years after injury, with broad individual variability. Epidemiological studies also suggest that TBI is a risk factor for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD). Further understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms by which TBI contributes to progressive cognitive decline/dementia is a prominent research priority for the NIH.\n\nAlthough TBI and ADRD have different etiologies, mounting evidence indicates that cerebrovascular dysfunction occurs in both TBI and ADRD. Impaired cerebral autoregulation (CA) and brain hypoperfusion are well documented after acute TBI which are associated with unfavorable functional outcomes at 6 months. Our recent studies and others using multimodal hemodynamic and imaging approaches have shown that impaired CA and brain hypoperfusion also occur in chronic TBI years after injury and are associated with poor cognitive performance. The 2019 ADRD Summit called for further studies to understand the vascular contributions to progressive cognitive impairment/dementia after TBI and develop non-invasive diagnostic approaches. The following important questions remain to be addressed: 1) What is the impact of cerebrovascular dysfunction after acute TBI on short- and long-term cognitive outcomes? 2) What is the temporal relationship between the recovery of cerebrovascular function and cognitive outcome after TBI? and 3) Is there a relationship between changes in cerebrovascular function and post-TBI neurodegeneration as assessed through changes in brain volume and axonal integrity?\n\nThe overarching goal of this proposal is to determine whether acute, subacute, and chronic cerebrovascular dysfunction measured by CA and brain perfusion after msTBI are associated with cognitive outcomes and neurodegeneration after 12 months. We hypothesize that the degree of cerebrovascular dysfunction assessed during the acute stage (\\<1 week postinjury) and its poor recovery during the first year are associated with poor cognitive outcomes, brain volume loss, and axonal damage at 12 months postinjury. We propose a longitudinal study with 100 adults who sustained a single msTBI19 and 30 controls with orthopedic trauma only. The primary cognitive outcome is the NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery (NIH\\_TB) fluid composite score at 12 months postinjury. Secondary clinical outcomes include the Glasgow Outcome Score-Extended (GOSE) and Traumatic Brain Injury Quality of Life (TBI-QOL). Brain volume loss and axonal integrity will be assessed using MRI. Our team has complementary expertise and research experience in TBI clinical care, cognitive outcomes after TBI, aging/dementia, cerebrovascular physiology, and neuroimaging to successfully conduct this project.\n\nAim 1: To determine the associations of cerebrovascular dysfunction assessed during the acute stage of msTBI (\\< 1 week postinjury) with cognitive outcome at 1 year. We will measure dynamic CA and brain perfusion using non-invasive multimodality approaches, including 2D duplex ultrasonography for cerebral blood flow (CBF), transcranial Doppler (TCD) for CBF velocity (CBFV), near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) for regional brain tissue oxygenation, and finger arterial photoplethysmography for beat-to-beat arterial blood pressure (ABP). CA will be quantified by dynamic changes in ABP and CBFV and brain tissue oxygenation. We hypothesize that the degree of cerebrovascular dysfunction during the acute stage of brain injury is inversely associated with 1) cognitive performance and 2) the GOSE and TBI-QOL score at 1 year postinjury.\n\nAim 2: To determine the temporal associations between the recovery of cerebrovascular function and cognitive outcomes after msTBI. Dynamic CA and brain perfusion will be measured at 3, 6 and 12 months postinjury. We hypothesize that the extent of cerebrovascular function recovery after TBI is associated temporally with 1) cognitive outcomes and 2) the GOSE and TBI-QOL score at 1 year postinjury.\n\nAim 3: To determine the temporal associations of acute cerebrovascular dysfunction and its recovery with the imaging biomarkers of neurodegeneration after msTBI. We will perform state-of-the-art MRI studies of brain structure and function at 3 months and 12 months postinjury. Brain imaging biomarkers will include whole and regional brain volumes and white matter axonal integrity. We hypothesize that the severity of acute cerebrovascular dysfunction and its poor recovery are associated with brain volume loss and axonal damage, and the associations between cerebrovascular dysfunction and cognitive outcome after TBI are mediated by the brain structural changes.\n\nThe findings from this study will improve our understanding of cerebrovascular contributions to cognitive and functional outcomes after TBI. This study will also provide the urgently needed knowledge of potential pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies targeting cerebrovascular function to improve cognition and slow neurodegeneration after TBI."

Unlike the GOSE, which does not distinguish between disability related to the brain injury and disability related to peripheral injuries sustained in the same incident, the R-GOSE assesses the impact of both non-CNS injuries (i.e. peripheral injuries) and the brain injury separately. As a result, two scores are obtained: an 'All' rating which reflects the participant's change in level of dependence as a function of peripheral and brain injuries combined, and a 'TBI' rating that removes the impact of the peripheral injuries leaving a disability rating that reflects only the TBI.",

Note that the five-point rating scale asks the respondent to compare his/her current symptoms (if any) to symptoms experienced prior to the current injury.

Our goal is to test if people with mild Alzheimer's disease can learn fall prevention skills from the exposure to large-scale perturbations on a treadmill. Two groups with mild Alzheimer's disease will be enrolled. One group will attend a perturbation training session while the other group receives no training. Groups will then be exposed to perturbations on the ground immediately and three or six months after the training. Over six months after the training, daily-living falls will be tracked for both groups. The falls following the perturbations in the lab and daily-living all-cause falls will be compared between groups to test our specific aims: 1) to test if people with Alzheimer's disease can adapt to large-scale external perturbations and learn fall resistant motor skills; 2) to inspect whether people with Alzheimer's disease can retain motor skills learned in Aim 1; and 3) to determine if people with Alzheimer's disease can generalize fall resistant skills to different contexts (treadmill to overground, inside the lab to outside the lab)."
