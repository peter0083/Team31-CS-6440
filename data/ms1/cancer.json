A shorter timeframe down to 2 weeks may be acceptable if the investigator feels that this is in the best interests of the patient.\n* Has received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy including investigational agents, phototherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study intervention excluding topical steroids. A shorter timeframe down to 2 weeks may be acceptable if the investigator feels that this is in the best interests of the patient.\n* Participants must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is permitted for palliative radiation (\u2264 2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-CNS disease.\n* Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette- Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., FluMist\u00ae) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.\n* Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past year (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids (exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n* Has known active CNS lymphoma. Participants with previously treated CNS lymphoma may participate provided they are radiologically stable, i.e. without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to first dose of study intervention.\n* Has severe hypersensitivity (\u2265 Grade 3) to pembrolizumab and/or any of its excipients.\n* Adjuvant or maintenance therapy to reduce the risk of recurrence of other malignancy (other than T-cell lymphoma) is permissible after discussion with the Principal Investigator.\n* Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection.\n* Has known active Hepatitis B (defined as Hepatitis B DNA detected by PCR) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA \\[qualitative\\] is detected) infection. Patients with evidence of prior hepatitis B infection require prophylaxis with entecavir or equivalent.\n* Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease that required steroids or has current pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease.\n* Has had an allogenic tissue/solid organ transplant.\n* Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis).\n* Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n* Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial.\n* Is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 6 months after the last dose of gemcitabine or 120 days after the last dose of pembrolizumab (whichever is later).

          "briefSummary": "This phase Ib trial studies the effects of venetoclax in combination with dasatinib, prednisone, rituximab and blinatumomab in treating patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is newly diagnosed or that has come back (relapsed). Venetoclax may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking Bcl-2, a protein needed for cancer cell survival. Dasatinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Anti-inflammatory drugs, such as prednisone lower the body's immune response and are used with other drugs in the treatment of some types of cancer. Rituximab and blinatumomab are monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Giving venetoclax in combination with dasatinib, prednisone, and rituximab and blinatumomab may help treat patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",
          "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine amaximum tolerated dose (MTD) and a subsequently recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of venetoclax in combination with dasatinib.\n\nII. Evaluate the safety of venetoclax in combination with dasatinib by assessing the frequency, type, and severity of adverse events.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Assess preliminary response to venetoclax in combination with dasatinib based on minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity.\n\nII. Estimate progression-free and overall survival.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate the distribution of BCR-ABL fusion sub-types. II. Assess changes in BCL-family dependence. III. Presence of co-occurring leukemia-specific mutations. IV. Assess ex vivo sensitivity to venetoclax and dasatinib using inhibitor plates and colorimetric cell viability (MTS) assay.\n\nV. Evaluate differences between two methods of detecting MRD for B ALL/mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL): Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ PCR) analysis of BCR-ABL and next generation (NextGen) sequencing.\n\nVI. Assess response after consolidation with blinatumomab, venetoclax, and dasatinib.\n\nOUTLINE: This is dose-escalation study of venetoclax.\n\nINDUCTION PHASE CYCLE 1: Patients receive prednisone orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days -6 to 21 and rapid taper from days 22-28, dasatinib PO QD days 1-28, venetoclax PO QD days 3-28 or days 3-21, rituximab (for CD20+ patients) intravenously (IV) on days 8 and 15, and methotrexate intrathecally (IT) once during week 1 and once during week 3 as prophylaxis or once a week (QW) as therapy in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nINDUCTION PHASE CYCLES 2-3: Patients receive dasatinib PO QD days 1-28, venetoclax PO QD on days 1-28 or 1-21, rituximab (for CD20+ patients) IV on days 1 and 15, and methotrexate IT on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeat every 28 days for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with clinical benefit may continue to receive treatment for up to 12 months per the discretion of the physician.\n\nCONSOLIDATION CYCLES 4-7 (ALL PATIENTS ONLY): Patients receive blinatumomab IV on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 42 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients continue to receive dasatinib PO QD and venetoclax PO QD as taken in cycles 1-3 and, if clinically indicated, methotrexate IT on day 1. Cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo bone marrow biopsy and aspiration, lumbar puncture, and blood sample collection throughout the study\n\nMAINTENANCE THERAPY CYCLES 8+: Patients receive dasatinib PO QD and venetoclax PO QD as in consolidation cycles and, if clinically indicated, methotrexate IT on day 1 of cycles 8 and 9. Cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 5 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks and then every 12 weeks for up to 1 year.\n\nAdditionally, patients undergo bone marrow biopsy and aspiration, lumbar puncture, and blood sample collection throughout the study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks and then for up to 1 year."

Participants with MPAL will be enrolled for induction therapy only\n* All individuals must have a bone marrow biopsy completed during the screening period. Patients with central nervous system (CNS) disease will be included\n* Expression of CD19 by flow cytometry on bone marrow, if individual has received prior chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T therapy. If CD19 negative, enrollment may be considered for induction treatment only\n* Newly diagnosed subjects must have received no prior treatment for their ALL with the exception of steroids (prednisone, dexamethasone), hydrea or IT methotrexate. Individuals may receive pre-treatment with steroids during the screening phase prior to enrollment\n* Individuals with relapsed disease may not have had prior treatment with dasatinib, however treatment with other tyrosine kinases is permitted\n* At least 3 half-lives must have passed before cycle 1 day 1 (C1D1) for participants that have used strong CYP3A inhibitors (such as fluconazole, ketoconazole and clarithromycin) prior to enrollment\n* At least 3 half-lives must have passed before cycle 1 day 3 (C1D3) for participants that have used moderate CYP3A inhibitors (such as fluconazole, ketoconazole and clarithromycin), strong or moderate CYP3A inducers (such as rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John's wort), P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, or warfarin prior to enrollment\n* At least 4 weeks must have passed before (C1D3) for participants that have recently received a live vaccine\n* Age \\>= 18 years. All participants irrespective of their gender identity and members of all races and ethnic groups will be included\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status =\\< 2\n* Must be able to take oral medication\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) \\< 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)\n\n  * Unless considered due to leukemic organ involvement\n* Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \\< 2.5 x ULN\n\n  * Unless considered due to leukemic involvement\n* Total bilirubin \\< 1.5 x ULN\n\n  * Unless considered due to leukemic organ involvement\n  * Note: subjects with Gilbert's Syndrome may have a bilirubin \\> 1.5 x ULN per discussion between the investigator and AbbVie medical monitor\n* Subject must have adequate renal function as demonstrated by a calculated creatinine clearance \\>= 50 mL/min; determined via urine collection for 24-hour creatinine clearance or by the Cockcroft-Gault formula\n* Persons of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (sensitivity \\< 25 IU human chorionic gonadotropin \\[HCG\\]/L) within 72 hours prior to the start of the study drug\n* Persons of reproductive potential must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception throughout treatment and for at least 4 weeks after study drug is stopped. Persons of childbearing potential and persons with a sexual partner of childbearing potential must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy\n* Normal corrected QT Formula (QTcF) interval on screening electrocardiogram (EKG) (\\< 450 ms regardless of sex)\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* For newly diagnosed subjects: who have received treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiotherapy or immunotherapy for their ALL/MPAL, or prior dasatinib treatment. For relapsed subjects: prior dasatinib treatment (however treatment with other tyrosine kinase inhibitors \\[TKIs\\] is permitted)\n* Subjects who have received any investigational agents or subjects who are taking investigational or commercial agents or therapies with the intent to treat the subject's malignancy within seven days or three half-lives of enrollment (i.e. initiation of dasatinib)\n* Subjects with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in myeloid blast crisis, Ph+ acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute leukemia lineage that cannot be classified based on existing criteria (e.g., from the World Health Organization \\[WHO\\] or International Consensus Classification \\[ICC\\])\n* Subjects with clinically serious infections as determined by the provider requiring ongoing antibiotic therapy. This does not include antibiotic treatment for neutropenic fever\n* Individuals with a pleural or pericardial effusion of any grade\n* Subjects with a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to dasatinib or other agents used in the study\n* Subjects who have undergone stem cell transplant must be at least 100 days after transplant, and without active treatment for graft versus host disease (GVHD) other than topical medications\n* Subjects with uncontrolled cardiac illness including but not limited to, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias (such as ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or Torsades de pointes), or pulmonary hypertension\n* Subjects with diagnosed congenital prolonged QT syndrome\n* Pregnant persons are excluded from this study because dasatinib is a pregnancy category D agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with dasatinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with dasatinib. These potential risks may also apply to venetoclax for which the pregnancy category and risks to the fetus are unknown\n* Participant is seropositive with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or has active infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV).\n\n  * HIV-infected individuals on effective anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months are eligible for this trial.\n  * For individuals with evidence of chronic HBV infection, the HBV viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated.\n  * Individuals with a history of HCV infection must have been treated and cured. For individuals with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load\n* Subjects with invasive malignancy over the previous year except treated early stage carcinomas of the skin, completely resected intraepithelial carcinoma of the cervix, completely resected papillary thyroid and follicular thyroid cancers, and localized prostate cancer treated with curative intent with surgery or radiation\n* Subjects with any gastrointestinal condition which would lead to inability to absorb an oral medication",

The successful treatment will target neurophysiologic mechanisms for restoring function while addressing patient-reported symptoms and participation in treatment. Toward this end, the investigators propose to study a noninvasive, social sensorimotor intervention - Adapted Argentine Tango - which targets motor control restoration, symptom alleviation, and treatment participation in concert.",

This project will expand the investigators' pilot work (R21-AG068831) into a multicenter clinical trial designed to investigate the effect of social dance on sensory relief, functional restoration, and key mechanisms of action among a diverse cohort of BC survivors suffering from chronic chemotherapy-induced sensorimotor deficits."

Steps available to teach, including order and cues to teach them, are detailed in Hackney's AdapTango manual. All steps are based on the Argentine Tango steps that emerged within working class community centers in Buenos Aires, Argentina (milongas) in the late 1800s and have been adapted by the investigators for use as medical exercise among people with mobility deficits. Of note, Argentine Tango is distinct from, and the precursor for, the American Tango style of competitive ballroom dance: where American Tango highlights showmanship and complicated footwork, Argentine Tango prioritizes connection between partners and musicality within a basic walk motion.",

          "briefSummary": "This phase I trial investigates the side effects of chemotherapy and cellular immunotherapy in treating children with IL13Ralpha2 positive brain tumors that have come back after a period of improvement (recurrent) or do not respond to treatment (refractory). Cellular immunotherapy (IL13(EQ)BBzeta/CD19t+ T cells) are brain-tumor specific cells that may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as as cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Many patients with brain tumor respond to treatment, but then the tumor starts to grow again. Giving chemotherapy in combination with cellular immunotherapy may kill more tumor cells and improve the outcome of treatment.",
          "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the feasibility and safety of lymphodepleting chemotherapy followed by cellular immunotherapy utilizing IL13Ralpha2-specific hinge-optimized 41BB-co-stimulatory chimeric antigen receptor \\[CAR\\] truncated CD19-expressing autologous T-lymphocytes (IL13\\[EQ\\]BBzeta/CD19t+ Tn/mem cells) administered by intraventricular (ICV) delivery for pediatric participants with IL13Ralpha2+ recurrent/refractory brain tumors.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To describe persistence and expansion of CAR T cells in peripheral blood (PB) and cerebrospinal (CSF).\n\nII. To describe cytokine levels (PB, and CSF) over the study period.\n\nIII. In research participants who receive the full schedule of 4 CAR T cell cycles:\n\nIIIa. To estimate 6-month progression free survival (PFS) rate per disease. IIIb. To estimate disease response rates per disease. IIIc. To estimate 1-year overall survival rate per disease. IV. To evaluate the use of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) to evaluate tumor burden.\n\nV. For study participants who undergo an additional biopsy/resection or autopsy:\n\nVa. To evaluate CAR T cell persistence in the tumor tissue and the location of the CAR T cells with respect to the infusion site. Vb. To evaluate IL13Ralpha2 antigen expression levels on tumor tissue pre and post CAR T cell therapy.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of IL13(EQ)BBzeta/CD19t+ T cells.\n\nPatients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on days -5 and -4, and fludarabine IV on days -5 to -2. Patients then receive autologous IL13(EQ)BBzeta/CD19t+ T cells intraventricularly over 5 minutes once a week (QW) on day 0. Treatment with autologous IL13(EQ)BBzeta/CD19t+ T cells repeats every 7 days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may receive additional cycles of IL13(EQ)BBzeta/CD19t+ T cells as long as they continue to meet eligibility criteria and have doses available for infusion.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up at 30 days, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, and then yearly for 15 years."

This initial outpatient evaluation will include magnetic resonance imaging with contrast of brain and spine and blood collection for research use. Participants with measurable hearing will have audiology assessment performed. Participants with untreated vestibular schwannomas will have vestibular assessment performed during the initial visit. Genetic studies performed outside will be acceptable as confirmation of NF2 in enrolled patients.

          "briefSummary": "This early phase I trial studies the side effects and feasibility of total body irradiation using intensity modulation radiation therapy (IMRT) when given in combination with cyclophosphamide prior to stem cell transplant to treat severe systemic sclerosis. IMRT delivers total body radiation therapy more precisely and may reduce radiation exposure to sensitive normal organs. Giving chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, and total body irradiation before a donor stem cell transplant helps kill cancer cells in the body and helps make room in the bone marrow for new blood-forming cells (stem cells) to grow. Giving IMRT and cyclophosphamide prior to stem cell transplant may work better in treating severe systemic sclerosis and reduce radiation doses to lung and kidneys compared to cyclophosphamide alone.",
          "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the feasibility of using IMRT to deliver total body irradiation (TBI) to 800 cGy while keeping mean lung and kidney doses to 200 cGy.\n\nII. To assess the safety/feasibility of total body irradiation using IMRT (IMRT TBI) in systemic sclerosis patients undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate dose homogeneity and dose sparing to lung and kidneys. II. To evaluate transplant-related mortality at 30 days and 100 days post IMRT TBI.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo TBI using IMRT twice daily (BID) on days -5 and -4 in the absence of disease progression or disease progression. Patients then receive cyclophosphamide on days -3 and -2 and undergo HSCT on day 0 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up on days 30 and 100."

          "briefSummary": "This study is exploring the use of Panitumumab in Head and Neck Cancer. Panitumumab is an approved drug named Vectibix and is used as an anti-cancer agent in other cancers such as colorectal cancer. It works by attaching to the cancer cell in a unique way that allows the drug to get into the cancer tissue. In addition to the Panitumumab, participants will also receive a Panitumumab-IRDye800 (Pan800) or a fluorescently labeled Panitumumab infusion. IRDye800 is an investigational dye that, when tested in the lab, helps various characteristics of human tissue show up better when using a special camera during surgery. Panitumumab-IRDye800 is a combination of the drug and the dye that attaches to cancer cells and appears to make them visible to the doctor when he or she uses the special camera during surgery.\n\nThe goal of this study is to use a novel and possibly safer approach to identify an optimal dose for panitumumab to treat cancer patients by using a new light-based therapy. In this study, different drug levels will be analyzed using this approach to understand how much drug reaches the tumor at different administered doses, which may help us provide safer and/or more effective therapies in the future.\n\nThe goal is to identify the correct amount or dose of a drug that is needed for effective cancer therapies. Often, clinical studies look at how much of the drug can be tolerated before patients become sick, rather than how much of the drug is required to be effective.\n\nIRDye800 is an investigational dye that, when tested in the lab, helps various characteristics of human tissue show up better when using a special camera during surgery. Panitumumab-IRDye800 is a combination of the drug and the dye that attaches to cancer cells and appears to make them visible to the doctor when he or she uses the special camera during surgery. This will help the surgeon with clinical margins during surgery and will may have a clearer way to differentiate between cancer and healthy tissue.",
          "detailedDescription": "The primary objective of this study is to understand biologic dosing of panitumumab which would contribute to the field by establishing new methodology for dose selection with the aim of reducing toxicity in cancer patients. For the individual patient in this trial, panitumumab itself is unlikely to demonstrate anti-tumor efficacy. However, previous studies have shown some benefit when using panitumumab-IRDye800 (pan800) as an imaging agent intraoperatively. The investigators hope to improve patient outcomes by gathering clinical data to support pan800 as a tool for reducing positive surgical margins and to identify malignant lymph nodes during surgical resection.\n\nThe drug being used in this study, panitumumab, is approved by the US FDA for treatment of certain types of advanced colorectal cancer at a dosage of 6 mg/kg given every 14 days. Many of the reported adverse events are associated with repeat administration of panitumumab, rather than 1-2 doses being administered in this study. However, the investigators do anticipate some adverse events at therapeutic dosing (anticipated grade 1-2). The most common side effects patients have experienced when receiving panitumumab primarily include skin reactions (including acne like rash, dry or itchy skin, cracking of skin around the participants nail beds, skin infections, and dry eyes), fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea.\n\nCurrently, there is no standardized method to identify the optimal biologic dose (OBD) for oncology therapies. Traditionally, dosing has been based on toxicity levels, specifically the maximally tolerated dose (MTD), rather than actual therapeutic effectiveness. In early-stage oncology trials, MTD often guides dose selection, with plasma drug concentrations serving as a rough measure for dose optimization. However, this plasma provides limited insight into how much of the drug actually reaches the tumor or binds to the intended target.\n\nThis study proposes a novel approach to finding OBD by measuring tumor drug concentration in head and neck cancer patients using an optically labeled antibody therapy. The investigators hypothesize that if a drug reaches a maximum concentration at a lower dose that previously thought, there may be no utility in increasing systemic dosing and risk unnecessary toxicity as well as financial burden.\n\nOur group has previously published data using a fluorescent labeled therapeutic antibody (panitumumab-IRDye800) to show heterogenous distribution of antibody within a patient tumor in head and neck cancer. These studies used a single standard dose of panitumumab-IRDye800 which was shown to localize to malignant tumor tissue with minimal adverse events. In this proposed clinical trial, investigators will leverage this previously used fluorescent drug to investigate tumor concentration at multiple dose points up to and including the current FDA approved therapeutic dose to investigate our primary objective. Investigators will similarly use intraoperative fluorescence to assess the ability of the labeled antibody to distinguish malignant vs benign tissue at a range of doses. This intraoperative use has the potential to help optimize surgical margins and identification of malignant lymph nodes in addition to our primary objective of dose selection.\n\nThe main aim of this study is to investigate tumor concentration of fluorescently-labeled panitumumab at multiple doses up to the current FDA-approved therapeutic dose of panitumumab. This will allow us to identify if tumor saturation with this agent occurs below the currently approved dose. For other molecularly-targeted agents, there is evidence that lower doses can provide similar therapeutic benefit to approved doses. For panitumumab, over 30% of patients receiving this agent receive dose reductions due to adverse effects, resulting in a significant proportion of patients receiving a dose that is below the approved level. However, it is unclear if patients receiving this reduced dose achieve tumor saturation and similar therapeutic benefit. In this study, researchers will investigate if tumor saturation plateaus at a lower dose - an objective in line with dose optimization guidelines from the FDA. Our group has previously published data using fluorescently-labeled panitumumab to show heterogenous distribution of antibody within a patient tumor in head and neck cancer. Data from our previous and current work have allowed us to elucidate the relationship between fluorescence and intratumoral antibody concentration. An additional aim of this study is to provide further data on the efficacy of fluorescently-labelled panitumumab in identifying cancer relative to surrounding normal tissue. Improved tumor localization of the fluorescent agent could facilitate improved margin resections in the operating room."

          "briefSummary": "This study will test an investigational drug called AZD1390 in combination with radiation therapy for the treatment of brain tumors. This is the first time AZD1390 is being given to patients. This study will test safety, tolerability and PK (how the drug is absorbed, distributed and eliminated) of ascending doses of AZD1390 in combination with distinct regimens of radiation therapy",
          "detailedDescription": "This first time-in patients (FTIP), open-label, multicentre study of AZD1390 will be conducted in the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan. It consists of three treatment arms: Arm A, B, C. The Japan dose confirmation part (Japan part) is a sub-study of Arm A. Sites from Japan will only participate in the Japan part. This Phase 1 study will assess safety and tolerability of AZD1390 in combination with radiation therapy (RT) in brain malignancies. The combination cohorts have been designed to assess escalating cumulative doses of AZD1390 in settings with 3 different radiation treatment regimens:\n\n* Arm A: 35 Gy over 2 weeks with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in patients with recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM). Arm A will also include the food effect cohort\n* Arms B: 30 Gy over two weeks with whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT)/ partial brain radiation therapy (PBRT) in patients with brain metastases. \\*\\*Arm B has now closed to recruitment\\*\\*\n* Arm C: 60 Gy over 6 weeks (IMRT) in patients with primary GBM Each arm provides standard of care RT for the disease setting indicated with the experimental agent being administered in dose escalating cohorts."

The primary hypotheses are that sacituzumab tirumotecan is: (1) superior to chemotherapy with respect to progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR in NSCLC with EGFR mutations; and (2) superior to chemotherapy with respect to overall survival (OS) in NSCLC with EGFR mutations."

          "briefSummary": "This clinical trial examines positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in evaluating cardiac radiation damage in patients with lung or esophageal cancer. As part of the treatment for lung or esophageal cancer, patients will undergo radiation therapy. Sometimes, during this treatment, the heart is also subjected to some radiation which could affect its function, either increasing or decreasing the function. It is not known the consequences of this change nor is it known if doctors can detect the changes associated with the radiation. Sarcoidosis FDG positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) scans are a common way to image cardiac inflammation and myocardial viability. This study may help doctors image the heart before, during and after radiotherapy to monitor any changes.",
          "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To characterize radiation-related functional imaging changes in the heart using sarcoidosis fludeoxyglucose F-18 (FDG) PET-CT imaging.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. 1. To evaluate the ability of imaging changes in the heart to predict for overall survival (OS).\n\nII. To evaluate the ability of imaging changes in the heart to predict for cardiac toxicity.\n\nIII. To evaluate the ability of imaging changes in the heart to predict for cardiac related death.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate radiation treatment planning strategies to reduce risk of cardiotoxicity.\n\nII. To determine the correlation between sarcoidosis FDG PET-CT scans and oncologic FDG PET-CT scans.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo sarcoidosis FDG PET-CT of the heart before, during and, after radiotherapy.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 12 and 24 months."

The safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of ELVN-001 will be assessed together with an evaluation of changes in BCR-ABL1 transcript. An understanding of the safety profile, PK and preliminary evidence of anti-CML activity will be used to inform future development of ELVN-001 in adults with CML. By virtue of its predicted pharmacological profile ELVN-001 has the potential to be tolerable and achieve a deep molecular response in patients with CML with or without T315I mutations who do not tolerate or benefit from available TKIs."

          "briefSummary": "This study is for patients who have bladder cancer that invades into the muscle wall of the bladder. The standard treatment for patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer is to give 4 cycles of chemotherapy with the drugs cisplatin and gemcitabine, then to do an operation to remove the bladder (cystectomy).\n\nIn this study, the investigators will test participants' bladder cancer to see if their bladder cancer has a receptor for testosterone inside the bladder cancer cells. If it has the testosterone receptor participants will receive a medication called Degarelix that lowers testosterone levels in the blood. Degarelix will be given during the period that participants are receiving the standard of care chemotherapy drugs gemcitabine and cisplatin.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects, good and bad, of adding Degarelix to standard chemotherapy for patients with bladder cancer that have the testosterone receptor.",
          "detailedDescription": "Annually, over 80,000 people will be diagnosed with urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) of the bladder in the USA, with over 17,000 deaths. For patients with muscle-invasive disease (stage II and IIIA), standard of care therapy is neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been shown by multiple clinical trials and meta-analyses to improve pCR rates, disease free survival, and overall survival when compared to cystectomy alone. Specifically, neoadjuvant gemcitabine/cisplatin has been shown to be tolerable and effective and is a level 1 recommendation for treatment of muscle invasive bladder cancer by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines.\n\nThe presence of a pCR in response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is prognostic, but only about 35% of patients achieve a pCR. Thus improved neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens are necessary to improve recurrence free survival and overall survival rates in patients with bladder cancer.\n\nUCC is more common in men than women, with incidence rates of 3:1 to 4:1. This disparity persists even after controlling for smoking and occupational hazards/exposures and is likely influenced by androgen signaling. Androgen receptor (AR) positive UCC cells display increased proliferation, migration, and invasion in the presence of androgen and these effects are nullified in the presence of an AR antagonist. Preclinical studies show decreased rates of UCC incidence in response to a chemical carcinogen in castrated mice versus sham castrated mice and AR knockout mice versus AR intact mice. In retrospective human studies patients with UCC receiving androgen targeted therapy for concurrent prostate cancer had approximately 50% lower recurrence rates of UCC. Similarly, men receiving androgen targeted therapy for prostate cancer or benign prostatic hyperplasia have lower incidence rates of UCC than men not receiving androgen directed therapy.\n\nTwo prospective human clinical trials related to this concept have been performed. The first evaluated enzalutamide (an AR antagonist) as chemoprevention in non-muscle invasive UCC. This study was closed due to poor accrual after accruing only one patient. The second study added enzalutamide to standard chemotherapy in patients with metastatic UCC. Seven patients accrued at the therapeutic dose of enzalutamide. Overall, there was no signal for increased efficacy. However, one patient achieved a complete response lasting 2 years at last report. This patient was noted to have \\>90% positivity for AR in their tumor and, notably, was the only woman to participate in the study (and presumably had low testosterone levels). These data support further evaluation of androgen targeted therapy in AR+ UCC.\n\nTASUC-neo is a pilot study conducted in patients with androgen receptor positive (AR+), pT2 - pT4, N0 - N1, M0 urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) of the bladder. The study medication, Degarelix, will be administered concurrently with neoadjuvant gemcitabine/cisplatin."

The study will enroll patients \u226518 years with inflammatory VEXAS syndrome receiving ongoing GC therapy for \u22654 consecutive weeks, requiring between 15 and 45 mg daily (of prednisone / prednisolone or equivalent) at the time of enrollment (randomization). Patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive pacritinib dose A (n=26), pacritinib dose B plus placebo (n=26), or placebo (n=26) for up to 24 weeks during a double-blind treatment period, followed by treatment with pacritinib during an open-label treatment period for up to 48 weeks, and a 30-day post-End of Treatment (EOT) follow-up period. Randomization will be stratified by prescribed GC dose on the day of randomization. All outcomes will be reported by treatment arm, and pair-wise comparison between each pacritinib arm and placebo will be performed in the double-blind treatment period.\n\nPatients who complete the double-blind treatment period at End of Week 24 or meet Early Failure criteria at End of Week 12 will transition to an open-label pacritinib treatment period through End of Week 48. In addition, if a study arm closes due to interim futility or safety, all patients currently randomized to that arm will transition to open-label treatment.\n\nStudy termination is planned approximately 1 year from the first dose of the last patient."

The microdevices will dwell in the tumor tissue for approximately 24 +/- 8 hours to allow time for tissue effects of the drugs in the microdevice reservoirs. Microdevices will then be removed by resection of the tumor mass during a previously planned, and clinically indicated, surgical procedure.\n* It is expected that about 20 people will take part in this research study.\n\nThis research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are examining this microdevice. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the microdevice as a tool to identify which cancer treatment is best for any disease."

The patient's surgical and/or medical gynecologic oncologist must also confirm the patient's medical fitness to undergo an additional biopsy procedure and the indicated surgical procedure. The patient must have a plan to undergo surgery for clinical purposes.\n* The following criteria must be met:\n\n  * Participants must have undergone an abdominal/pelvic CT scan that both assesses the extent of disease and identifies an area of tumor amenable to safe microdevice placement. CT scans with both oral and IV contrast media are preferred but not required.\n\nCT scans performed at outside institutions are acceptable providing that the images are considered adequate to assess the stage of the disease and to assess the safety and feasibility of the placement of the microdevices and their retrieval during standard-of care surgery. CT scan must be completed within 4 weeks prior to the microdevice placement.\n\n* Patient has sufficient volume of disease as measured by CT scan to allow implantation of the microdevice.\n* Patient has sufficient volume of disease that removal of the lesion where the microdevice is placed will not potentially affect adequate tissue for diagnosis.\n* A lesion can be selected where the microdevice is to be implanted that is\n\n  * Amenable to percutaneous placement\n  * Amenable to removal at the time of surgery or laparoscopy. If patient is undergoing laparoscopy, the lesion must be able to be removed using a laparoscopic approach in a manner that would not significantly alter the procedure or affect patient safety, per opinion of the surgical oncologist.\n\n    * Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n    * Patients must be willing to undergo research-related genetic sequencing (somatic and germline) and data management, including the deposition of de-identified genetic sequencing data in NIH central data repositories.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit the safety of a biopsy and/or surgery.\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the possible increased dose of radiation from imaging associated with the microdevice placement and the potential risk to the pregnancy of the biopsy/device placement in an abdominal lesion.\n* Uncorrectable bleeding or coagulation disorder known to cause increased risk with surgical or percutaneous biopsy procedures.\n* Significant risk factors (including, but not limited to, high risk of venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke or myocardial infarction) precluding the safe cessation of anticoagulation medication as per SIR guidelines.

          "detailedDescription": "This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study is designed to compare the efficacy and safety of two dose levels of ficlatuzumab combined with cetuximab (Arm 1 or Arm 2) to a control arm of placebo plus cetuximab (Arm 3) in participants with R/M human papilloma virus (HPV)-negative HNSCC. Eligible participants must have failed prior therapy with an anti-PD-1 \\[programmed cell death protein 1\\] or PD-L1 \\[programmed death ligand 1\\] immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) and with platinum-based chemotherapy, administered in combination or sequentially. Failure of prior treatment may be due to progression of disease or intolerance to treatment. It is anticipated that the study will enroll approximately 410 participants across 3 arms."
