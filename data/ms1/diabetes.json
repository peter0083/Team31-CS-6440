Prior or current therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate, growth hormone, or Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1).\n7. Diagnosis of short stature, i.e., more than 2.25 standard deviations (SD) below the mean height-for-age.\n8. Known history of seizures, epilepsy, and/or central nervous system disorders that may have been associated with seizures or convulsions.\n9. Prior (within 2 months of study treatment start) or current use of medications that have been associated with seizures or convulsions.\n10.

          "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to find out whether the COVID pandemic has affected participants' current physical activity, fitness, blood pressure, sleep, and mental stress to better understand its long-term health effects. To complete this study, participants will visit the Neurovascular Physiology Laboratory (NVPL) at the Indiana University School of Public Health Bloomington two times, requiring a total commitment of about 6 hours.\n\nVisit 1 involves completing screening questionnaires, a consent document, and additional questionnaires about participant health behaviors (e.g., sleep and physical activity) and general mental and physical health. After the visit, participants will also start tracking their sleep and physical activity using wearable devices for 14 days, diet for at least 3 days, and blood pressure and urine for 24 hours.\n\nVisit 2 is a second data collection visit, where participants will return the wearable devices. The investigators will measure participants' body composition, take measures of their cardiovascular health, and participants will complete a fitness test on a stationary cycle (exercise bike). The investigators will collect a 24 hour urine sample and take a blood sample to measure participants' blood glucose, electrolytes, hydration biomarkers, and markers of inflammation, as well as to study immune cells. The investigators will take participants' blood pressure at rest and during a hand-in-cold water test, which helps assess how participants' nervous system responds to stress. A full-body scan will measure participant body composition including bone density, muscle mass, and body fat percentage. Finally, participants will complete a cycling test that gradually increases in intensity to measure cardiovascular fitness.\n\nRisks involve potential pain or bruising from blood draws, discomfort from blood pressure cuffs, stress from vigorous cycling, and psychological stress from questionnaires. There's also a slight risk of severe cardiovascular events occurring during exercise and loss of data confidentiality. Finally, the cold water test may result in a rare but noted situation where the body's nervous system overreacts to the cold stimulus, leading to a drop in blood pressure and heart rate. Participants will be monitored by trained staff during all procedures to ensure safety.",
          "detailedDescription": "The investigator will be assessing whether prior severity of COVID-19 or (Post-acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection) PASC is associated with reduced physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness, impaired blood pressure regulation, worse sleep, or heightened mental stress. Participants will report to the laboratory for two visits.\n\nVisit 1 will be comprised of participant consent, screening, and completing questionnaires surrounding sleep, stress and mental health, food security, and habitual beverage intake. Visit 1 will take approximately 2 hours in total. Participants will be asked to read the consent form at this time and be encouraged to ask any questions. Participants can then: 1) sign the consent form; 2) take it home for further consideration; or 3) decide not to participate. Participants will be screened for eligibility once written informed consent has been given. At the conclusion of the first visit, participants will be given devices to track ambulatory blood pressure for 24 hours, physical activity and sleep for \\~14 days, and diet for \u22653 days (i.e., 2 week days and 1 weekend day). 24 hours before the experimental visits, participants will be given a 24-hour urine collection container to measure urine volume, urine electrolyte concentrations, urine electrolyte excretion, and urine osmolality for eventual assessment of biomarkers of kidney function and kidney injury.\n\nVisit 2 will be an experimental visit where each participant will undergo applied physiology measures, body composition, and exercise testing. During experimental visits, a blood draw will take place to assess changes in plasma electrolyte concentration, osmolality, hemoglobin, and hematocrit, and coded samples will be stored for future inflammation measures (e.g., CRP and IL-6) in addition to isolating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for studying immune cell phenotype. Participants will then have rested BP assessed. Arterial stiffness will be measured using noninvasive tonometry techniques (Pulse Wave Analysis and Pulse Wave Velocity via SphygmoCor XCEL). We will use a hand-in cold-water test (described below) to assess sympathetic nervous system excitation. The cold pressor test is where participants will submerge their hand into an ice-cold bucket of water for three minutes to elicit a sympathetic nervous system stress response. Concurrently, BP reactivity will be assessed using a cold pressor test while participants engage in submaximal exercise on a stationary bicycle. Blood pressure reactivity will be measured at the finger using a finger-specific blood pressure cuff that will measure BP on a beat-to-beat basis. A total-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (iDXA) scan will be used to assess bone mineral density, lean muscle mass, fat mass, and body fat percentage. Participants will finish the visit by completing a submaximal ramp cycling test on an electronically braked cycle ergometer to assess cardiovascular fitness. The test will begin at a low workload and increase incrementally every 30 minutes until the participant reaches 70% of their estimated maximal heart rate. Heart rate, workload, and perceived exertion will be recorded throughout to estimate cardiorespiratory fitness.\n\nCollectively, these measures will enable the investigators to determine the study objectives pertaining to whether prior COVID-19 severity or PASC impacts cardiovascular health, which have important public health implications."

          "briefSummary": "The goal of this project was to reduce and manage obesity and increase self-efficacy for keeping a healthy weight and improve pain, quality of life, and mental health symptoms among 60 adults aged 19 and older in Camden City, New Jersey. The City of Camden has an adult obesity rate of 44.1%. Obesity and aging are significant contributing factors to increased utilizations of healthcare services. Obesity is a major risk factor for non-communicable illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, pain, and mental health. Physical activity is effective in reducing and managing obesity. However, personal barriers (e.g., lack of time for physical activity, physical capability to perform physical activities, competing demands), built environment (e.g., safe spaces for physical activities), climate changes (e.g., heat waves and extreme weather which prevent outdoor physical activities), and systematic barriers (e.g., intervention availability) hamper obesity prevention and management in older adult population. To help older adults keep a healthy weight, our team has adapted and delivered the effective person-centered integrative interventions: HealthyWE: Keeping a Healthy Weight program to older adults in Camden New Jersey. Completion of the project will build a strong community capacity in Camden to sustain a community effort to reduce obesity and pain.",
          "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this project was to pilot test a web-based weight loss program called HealthyWE will help adults lose weight and decrease pain among adults in Camden City New Jersey. The proposed study was a one group pretest and posttest design.\n\nA. Aims\n\n1. Between 10/1/2023 and 9/30/2024, Rutgers University overarching goal was to reduce obesity incidence from 45% to 32% (30% reduction based on Camden County Health Department data for adult obesity) among adults living in Camden City and increase self-efficacy for keeping a healthy weight to improve quality of life and mental health symptoms.\n2. Between 10/1/2023 and 5/1/2024, Rutgers University sought to recruit 60 overweight and obese participants into the HealthyWE Corps, an obesity reduction/prevention program focused on educating the public about nutrition, exercise, and a healthy mind at three sites in the city of Camden.\n3. Between 10/1/2023 and 10/1/2024, Rutgers University hired and managed 3 instructors (one each in the areas of community-based nutrition education, exercise and physical activity, and mental health wellness) to lead HealthyWE Corps participants through lessons and activities focused on these areas between 1/16/2024 and 5/1/2024. Activities are designed to increase HealthyWE Corps participants capacity to engage other community members in activities related to these focus areas.\n4. Between 5/1/2023 and 9/30/2024, Rutgers University assessed feasibility of HealthyWE Corps by examining (a) program accrual of adults (N=60 by 1/16/2024); (b) protocol adherence (\\>80% adherence to protocol, which involves the degree to which program participants engage in program activities between 5/1/2023 and 9/30/2024); and (c) participant retention (\\>80% data collected at evaluation appointments: pre-assessment, mid-point assessment, post-assessment).\n5. Between 5/1/2024 and 9/30/2024, Rutgers University evaluated the self-efficacy for keeping a healthy weight and program adherence with expected outcome of 50% of HealthyWE Corps participants demonstrating good to excellent self-efficacy and program adherence through daily use of a FitBit-style tracker device to record their daily exercise and other health information (no health information will be collected for research purposes from the tracker device).\n6. Between 5/1/2024 and 9/30/2024, Rutgers University conducted program outcome evaluation on 60 HealthyWE Corps participants to assess the effectiveness of the HealthyWE Corps program on primary outcomes of weight, BMI, and self-efficacy, and secondary outcomes of quality of life and mental health symptoms and participants overall satisfaction with the program.\n\n1.2 Research Significance Obesity remains a major public health crisis. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the prevalence of obesity is higher among adults (41.5%) than younger adults (39.5%). With respect to race and ethnicity, the overall prevalence of obesity is higher among non-Hispanic Black (49.9%) and Hispanic adults (45.6%) than among non-Hispanic White (41.4%). African American women have the highest prevalence of obesity (54.8%), followed by Hispanic women (50.6%) and Hispanic men (43.1%), respectively. Severe obesity is more prevalent among women, Black Americans, and low-income adults. The public health impact of obesity is profound. It is a major risk factor for non-communicable illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, pain, and mental health. Obesity increases risk for pain and worsens overall pain severity and interference. Further, individuals with obesity report poor physical and psychological quality of life and disproportionately reduces life expectancy. Obesity and aging are significant contributing factors to increased utilizations of healthcare services.\n\nCamden City in New Jersey is at high risk for poorer health outcomes (e.g., obesity, pain) for a myriad of socio-economic factors and a lack of a built environment that supports health. Camden City in New Jersey is ranked as Number Four top overweight cities in the United States with 44.1% of the adult population are obese and 44.6% of the adults do not engage in leisure time activity.9 The disparate rate of obesity occurring in Camden residents is the result of complex interaction of social determinants of health (e.g., poverty, education, and housing) and neighborhood structural barriers. Camden City in New Jersey represents many overburdened communities in the United States where minority or low-income communities bear disproportionately poor human health outcomes (e.g. obesity) and environmental risks. The 8.9-mile city is the home to 73,236 residents with the average household income of $41,180 and the poverty rate of 36%. The predominant races of the residents are Black (41.4%), Hispanic (27.6%), and White (23.5%).\n\nAs a complex disease, obesity is the accumulation of body fat and an inflammatory condition that results from many contributing factors, such as malnutrition, lack of physical activity, stress, and inadequate sleep.18-22 The standard criterion to define obesity is a body mass index (BMI) 30 kg/m2 or higher. Individuals who are obese are typically on the receiving end of health education and behavioral change recommendations to increase their intake of fresh fruits and vegetables along with prescriptions for physical activity of 30 minutes a day for most days of the week. In Camden, however, these recommendations are hampered by a lack of access to safe spaces for physical activity and healthy food. In addition, personal barriers (e.g., lack of time for physical activity, physical capability to perform physical activities, competing demands, cost of healthy food, built environment (e.g., safe spaces for physical activities), climate changes (e.g., heat waves and extreme weather which prevent outdoor physical activities), and systematic barriers (e.g., intervention availability) further hamper obesity prevention and management. Prevention and management of obesity necessitates integrative approach in communities like Camden to take into considerations of individual's physical capacity, built environment for physical activity and access to good nutrition.\n\nRutgers University has a well-earned international reputation for excellence that is integral to our priority of addressing healthcare disparities both in the U.S. and globally. Rutgers University-Camden has been named a Minority Serving Institution (MSI) by the Department of Education under Titles III and V of the Higher Education Act. Advancing health equity is the highest priority of Rutgers School of Nursing-Camden. Social justice is the fundamental value and unifying theme informing our School of Nursing strategic direction. Faculty and students believe a person's zip code should not determine the quality of their health care. However, we recognize neighborhoods and built environments do in fact make an enormous impact on access to care, good health, and well-being. The zip codes for the project are 08104 and 08105 in the City of Camden.\n\nBased on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations for prevention and management of overweight and obesity and personal and structural barriers faced by low-income older adult residents in Camden City, our team has adapted the effective and person-centered integrative interventions: HealthyWE Corps. This program is an AmeriCorps service program adapted to increase participant knowledge of and engagement in healthy nutrition, healthy exercise, and mental health wellness. Community service has been demonstrated to be an effective method of increasing individual self-efficacy and evidence for being effective for reducing weight in adults."

The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Is there a difference in weight loss between the behavioral program that includes aerobic exercise plus yoga compared to the behavioral program that includes only aerobic exercise?\n* Is there a difference in how much physical activity is completed between the behavioral program that includes aerobic exercise plus yoga compared to the behavioral program that includes only aerobic exercise?\n* Is there a difference in the change in body composition (fat mass, lean body mass) between the behavioral program that includes aerobic exercise plus yoga compared to the behavioral program that includes only aerobic exercise?\n* Is there a difference in the change in cardiorespiratory fitness the behavioral program that includes aerobic exercise plus yoga compared to the behavioral program that includes only aerobic exercise?\n* Is there a difference in the change in muscle strength between the behavioral program that includes aerobic exercise plus yoga compared to the behavioral program that includes only aerobic exercise?\n* Is there a difference in the change in resting blood pressure between the behavioral program that includes aerobic exercise plus yoga compared to the behavioral program that includes only aerobic exercise?\n* Is there a difference in the change in food intake or eating behaviors between the behavioral program that includes aerobic exercise plus yoga compared to the behavioral program that includes only aerobic exercise?\n* Is there a difference in the change in feelings of stress or mood between the behavioral program that includes aerobic exercise plus yoga compared to the behavioral program that includes only aerobic exercise?\n* Is there a difference in the change in sleep between the behavioral program that includes aerobic exercise plus yoga compared to the behavioral program that includes only aerobic exercise?\n* Is there a difference in the change in mindfulness between the behavioral program that includes aerobic exercise plus yoga compared to the behavioral program that includes only aerobic exercise?\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* Participate in a weight loss program for a period of 12 months that involves attending behavioral weight loss sessions. This involves coming to a session at the research center weekly for the initial 6 months and then every other week for the remaining 6 months.\n* Attempt to reduce the amount of food that they eat to reduce the calories they consume.\n* Participate in a combination of aerobic exercise plus yoga or just aerobic exercise.\n* Keep a record of the food they consume, use a digital scale provided to them, and wear an activity tracker provided to them for the period of 12 months.\n* Visit the clinical before starting the weight loss program, after 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months to complete measurements of their weight and other measurements to monitor their progress.\n* Complete exercise sessions in the clinic between weeks 2-6, at month 6, and at month 12 to provide information about how they response to a single session of exercise."

The main question to answer is: Does the use of the Diabetes Application significantly affect clinical outcomes of diabetes and cardiometabolic risk factors (BMI and Blood Pressure)? Patients will be enrolled in one of two available arms of the study.\n\nParticipants in the 'intervention arm' will use the app to view educational information presented as videos in the following areas: Healthy Coping, Healthy Eating, Staying Active, Medications (Use and Safety), Problem Solving in Diabetes and Disease Pathophysiology. They will continue routine follow-up care with their primary care physicians during the study.\n\nParticipants in the 'control arm' will continue with their primary care physician in routine follow-up care, as normally scheduled.\n\nResearchers will compare the intervention arm participants to the control arm participants to find out about and compare changes in HA1C, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and body mass index. Groups will also be compared on the basis of self-perceived confidence of managing their diabetes by way of the Diabetes Self Efficacy Scale."

          "briefSummary": "Purpose: To examine the effect of addition of combination therapy with dapagliflozin plus pioglitazone to insulin on glucose control and plasma ketone concentration in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) Research Design: 120 patients with type 1 diabetes who otherwise are healthy constitute the study population. After screening, eligible subjects will start 4 week run in. At week 4, subjects will receive dapagliflozin for 12 weeks. At week 16, subjects will be randomized to receive in a double blind fashion pioglitazone or placebo for 16 weeks.\n\nMethods: the following techniques will be employed in the present study: (1) mixed meal tolerance test; (2) indirect calorimetry; (3) continuous glucose monitoring.\n\nClinical Relevance: the results of the present study will demonstrate that the addition of pioglitazone to SGLT2 inhibitor in T1DM patients produces greater reduction in the HbA1c without increasing risk of ketoacidosis and hypoglycemia.",
          "detailedDescription": "Insulin deficiency, due to autoimmune destruction of beta cells, is the primary factor responsible for the development of T1DM, and insulin replacement therapy is the mainstay for the management of hyperglycemia. However, insulin therapy often is associated with adverse events, including weight gain which promotes insulin resistance leading to an increase in insulin demand. This results in a self-perpetuating vicious cycle whereby the increase in insulin dose causes weight gain that worsens insulin sensitivity, and further enhances insulin requirement. Hyperinsulinemia per se also induces insulin resistance.\n\nTo break this cycle, adjunctive therapies have been added to insulin in T1DM patients to lower the plasma glucose concentration. However, the addition of metformin, pioglitazone, and GLP-1 agonists to insulin in T1DM patients have not provided convincing evidence for a clinically meaningful reduction in the HbA1c or significant reduction in daily insulin dose.\n\nSGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are a novel class of antidiabetic agents which reduce the plasma glucose concentration by inhibiting renal glucose reuptake and producing glucosuria. Because of this unique mechanism of action, which is independent of insulin secretion and insulin action, SGLT2i have proven to be very effective in lowering the plasma glucose concentration in T1DM. Initial proof of concept studies have demonstrated that, compared to placebo, all members of this class (dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, canagliflozin and sotagliflozin) effectively lower the plasma glucose concentration, HbA1c and daily insulin dose in T1DM without increased risk of hypoglycemia. Further, SGLT2i improved cardiovascular risk factors in T1DM by promoting weight loss and decreasing blood pressure.\n\nDespite the promising potential for SGLT2i as adjunctive therapy to insulin in T1DM, recent large clinical trials have demonstrated two important limitations to this therapeutic strategy: First, although the decrease in HbA1c caused by SGLT2i in T1DM patients was statistically significant, the absolute decrease was relatively modest (0.30-0.45%). The investigators, previously have shown that SGLT2i stimulate an increase in the basal rate of hepatic glucose production (HGP) in T2DM patients. This SGLT2i-induced increase in HGP offsets by approximately one half the amount of glucose lost in the urine. Therefore, the investigators have hypothesize that, similar to what they have observed in T2DM patients, the addition of SGLT2i to insulin in T1DM patients stimulates HGP thereby attenuating the decrease in HbA1c. Further, the decrease in daily insulin dose after initiating therapy with SGLT2i in T1DM patients would be expected to enhance the increase in HGP and diminish the decrease in HbA1c. Thus, preventing the increase in HGP caused by SGLT2i in T1DM can be expected to markedly amplify the clinical efficacy of SGLT2i and enhance the reduction in HbA1c.\n\nA second limitation of the use of SGLT2i an adjunct therapy to insulin in T1DM patients is the increase in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) risk. In three large clinical trials , the addition of SGLT2i to insulin in T1DM patients was associated with a 3-6% increase in DKA risk (see Table 1 below). Because of the significant morbidity and mortality associated with DKA, the increased DKA risk in T1DM has raised concerns about the use of SGLT2i as an adjunct therapy to insulin in T1DM patients despite their multiple metabolic benefits.\n\nThe Investigators previously have demonstrated that SGLT2i cause a significant increase in plasma FFA concentration, fat oxidation and subsequent increase in plasma ketone concentration in T2DM patients (27). Therefore, they hypothesize that in T1DM, SGLT2i cause a similar increase in plasma FFA concentration, fat oxidation and plasma ketone concentration which in certain clinical conditions (e.g. acute illness) can increase the production of ketones and result in the development of DKA. Further, prevention of the increase in plasma FFA concentration will inhibit the increase in plasma ketone concentration and reduce DKA risk associated with SGLT2i use in T1DM patients.\n\nPioglitazone inhibits lipolysis and markedly decreases the plasma FFA concentration. Further, pioglitazone is a potent inhibitor of HGP. These actions of pioglitazone are due to direct actions of the drug on adipocytes and liver, respectively, are mediated by PPAR gama, and are independent of the plasma insulin and glucagon concentrations. In fact, pioglitazone inhibits lipolysis and HGP in type 2 diabetic patients despite a decrease in plasma insulin concentration. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that the addition of pioglitazone to SGLT2i in T1DM patients will prevent the rise in HGP caused by SGLT2i and, thereby, augment the decrease in HbA1c. Further, combination therapy with pioglitazone plus SGLT2i will prevent the increase in plasma FFA concentration and subsequent increase in plasma ketone concentration, thus reducing the risk of DKA."

          "briefSummary": "The recent development of dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) technology for hyperpolarized (HP) 13C imaging offers a promising new avenue for non-invasively accessing fundamental metabolic changes associated with the progression of fatty liver disease in vivo. The purpose of this pilot study is to optimize sequence parameters for hyperpolarized 13C acquisition in the human liver and determine which metabolic changes can be seen in humans with simple, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) when compared to healthy volunteers.",
          "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n1. Optimize scan parameters in order to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of the HP 13C-pyruvate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the liver.\n2. Determine whether the level of lactate production (as measured by the lactate/pyruvate ratio) in NASH participants, participants with simple NAFL, and healthy volunteers.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n1. Develop data analysis methods to quantify HP C-13 pyruvate MRI data.\n2. Further characterize the safety profile of HP C-13 pyruvate injections.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\n1. Examine the impact of the dual liver blood supply on the vascular kinetics of observed hyperpolarized 13C metabolism.\n2. Improve methods of quantification and motion correction for hyperpolarized 13C acquisition, incorporating perfusion information derived from 13C Urea\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPart 1: (Imaging Optimization, N=50): Participants enrolled in Part 1 will predominantly be healthy volunteers. As the protocol optimization is completed, there is a possibility that testing in using data from participants with fatty liver disease may be performed. Participants in this part will be divided into two cohorts:\n\n* Cohort A: Participants will undergo MRI but no injection of hyperpolarized 13C.\n* Cohort B: Participants will receive one HP 13C injection. Participants in this cohort will have the option of undergoing repeated dose imaging studies of HP 13C-pyruvate or HP 13C-pyruvate+HP 13C-urea \"copol\", for up to a total of two injections per imaging visit.\n\nPart 2: (Pilot Study, N=30): Participants enrolled in Part 2 will receive the HP 13C-pyruvate or HP13C-pyruvate+HP13C-urea \"copol\" protocol that was optimized in Part 1 as well as standard liver MRI pulse sequences. Participants will be stratified into the following groups based on diagnosis:\n\n* Group 1 (n=10): Participants with a diagnosis of non-alcoholic fatty liver without steatohepatitis (NAFL)\n* Group 2 (n=10): Participants with a diagnosis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)\n* Group 3 (n=10): Participants with no known liver disease (healthy volunteers)\n\nParticipants will be followed for 2-4 days following imaging procedure."

Severe hypoglycemia can be dangerous and debilitating and can also impact cognitive function. At the moment no medical therapies have been developed for this disorder. Determining why some but not other patients develop this condition would allow for improved prediction, prevention, and treatment approaches. The purpose of the study is to understand the physiological changes observed in those patients who undergo gastric bypass and develop symptomatic hypoglycemia."

          "briefSummary": "Sugar-sweetened beverage consumption is a major contributor to childhood obesity, caries, fatty liver disease, and Type 2 diabetes. Latino children are more likely to consume sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and to suffer from all of the aforementioned conditions. Reading out loud to children from birth through age 5 is critical for the promotion of language and early literacy skills. Children whose parents read aloud to them are more likely to start school with the skills required for early reading success. This is important as reading proficiency in third grade is the best predictor of high school graduation and career success. Latino children are less likely to be read to than non-Hispanic white children and at higher risk of entering kindergarten without critical early literacy skills. Thus, there is a pressing need for interventions to reduce SSB consumption among Latino children as well as interventions that promote reading out loud. Primary care is an optimal setting for such interventions. However, multiple demands on providers' time make it difficult to rely on in-person interventions. For this reason, it is critical to test intervention designs that do not rely directly on health care providers and that can be delivered remotely if needed. The investigators have developed two m-health interventions for Latino parents, one that promotes optimal beverage consumption patterns and one that promotes reading out loud to children. The purpose of this study is to test the impact of these interventions on child beverage intake patterns and the frequency with which parents read to children."

Following this, the investigators will proceed with a randomized, controlled crossover trial involving 20 overweight and pre-diabetic adults. This main study phase will compare the metabolic effects of daily Bottarga supplementation to those of a calorically matched dairy product over an 8-week period, with a 2-week washout period between interventions.\n\nThe investigators anticipate that Bottarga supplementation will lead to improvements in lipid profiles, inflammation, and insulin resistance, which could promote the use of sustainable blue foods as part of a healthy diet.",
          "detailedDescription": "Rationale/goals: Greek Bottarga (Grey mullet fish roe) is a traditional marine or \"blue\" food \"that is produced in a sustainable manner. Bottarga's composition supports that it has excellent nutritional properties, but to date no human/clinical studies have been published. This pilot study will explore the potential benefits of Bottarga consumption in humans. If the results show potential benefits, this would help promote more sustainable blue foods. Methods: Before initiating the crossover randomized controlled trial (RCT), the investigators will conduct a preliminary dose-testing study in five overweight and pre-diabetic adults, who will consume 20 g/day of Bottarga. Participants will undergo clinical assessments before and after the dietary intervention to evaluate changes in metabolic health markers.\n\nThe current randomized, controlled, cross-over pilot study (Open Label, Two-Arms) will investigate the metabolic effects of daily bottarga supplementation (versus a calorically equal dairy product) in 20 overweight and pre-diabetic participants for 8 weeks with a 2-week \"washout\" period between food supplement arms. The primary outcome will be determined based on the most clinically important results observed during phase 1. Anticipated Results: The investigators expect Bottarga supplementation to be associated with more beneficial changes on lipid profiles, inflammatory markers and insulin resistance compared to baseline measures and to the calorically equivalent comparator food."

          "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to learn about how the hormone insulin controls blood sugar. The main question it aims to answer is about how much insulin the body actually needs to maintain a normal blood sugar level. People with obesity and high insulin levels will receive eight doses of diazoxide, a drug that suppresses the pancreas's production of insulin, and will have their fasting blood sugar and insulin levels checked daily while taking the drug.",
          "detailedDescription": "The investigators are interested in determining to what extent the hyperinsulinemia commonly associated with insulin resistance (IR) in those at risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a primary phenomenon, rather than merely a secondary, compensatory response to IR. The study hypothesis is that some people with obesity and hyperinsulinemia exhibit a primary, non-compensatory hyperinsulinemia that may foment IR and its dysmetabolic sequelae. If this were the case, lowering insulin levels should not result in a proportional rise in blood glucose as might be expected if the hyperinsulinemia truly were purely compensatory. This hypothesis has been difficult to prove, however, because of the tight feedback mechanism between blood glucose and insulin secretion; under normal circumstances insulin secretion declines only alongside blood glucose. As such, an attempt to lower insulin levels independently of blood glucose will raise blood glucose and trigger further insulin secretion, negating the purpose of the experiment. In order to circumvent this feedback regulation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, the study team has developed a modification of the insulin suppression test (IST) called the \"graded IST\" (GIST) that suppresses endogenous insulin secretion with octreotide and then measures steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG) at both replacement euinsulinemia and hyperinsulinemia. It is expected that some people with high insulin levels at baseline will not demonstrate a prominent rise in SSPG even when their insulin levels are lowered. However, the GIST is a cumbersome procedure that is difficult to scale for larger study populations. As such, the investigators are also working to develop an outpatient diazoxide suppression test (DzST) that suppresses endogenous insulin secretion with the oral insulin anti-secretagogue diazoxide rather than octreotide, and will validate it against the incipient \"gold-standard\" GIST. GIST participants found to have evidence of primary hyperinsulinemia (i.e., euinsulinemic euglycemia or near-euglycemia despite baseline hyperinsulinemia) will, several weeks later, take diazoxide 3 mg/kg per dose, twice daily, for four days. The investigators will check fasting glucose and insulin levels daily at baseline and then after each of the four days of diazoxide administration. The investigators expect that suppression of insulin secretion with diazoxide will, in accordance with the GIST, lead to no significant rise in blood glucose in people who have true primary hyperinsulinemia."

          "briefSummary": "This clinical study is being conducted to evaluate how well the Miro3D Wound Matrix helps heal difficult wounds and ulcerations in an outpatient care setting. Miro3D is a biologic wound dressing made from porcine (pig) liver tissue. It is processed to remove all cells, creating a clean scaffold that can support the body's natural healing process. The goal of this study is to see how effective Miro3D is when used alongside standard wound care for helping wounds close and reducing pain and discomfort.\n\nThe study is designed as a post-market, proof-of-concept trial, meaning the product is already commercially available, and researchers are evaluating how it works in real-world clinical settings. A total of up to 20 adult participants will be enrolled. Participants may have wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, pressure ulcers, or surgical wound dehiscence. These wounds may be complex in nature, including tunneling or undermining, which often makes them more difficult to treat.\n\nParticipants will receive standard wound care along with weekly Miro3D applications for the first 4 weeks. If the wound is not fully healed after 4 weeks, Miro3D will then be applied every 2 weeks until healing is achieved or up to 12 weeks total. Throughout the study, participants will return weekly for wound assessments and to complete brief questionnaires about their pain levels and quality of life.\n\nThe main goals of the study are:\n\n1. To measure how much the wound size shrinks (known as percent area reduction or PAR).\n2. To evaluate how much healthy granulation tissue (new tissue) forms in the wound.\n3. To compare healing outcomes when Miro3D is used weekly versus every two weeks.\n4. To understand how the treatment affects patients' quality of life, including pain, mobility, and emotional wellbeing.\n\nEach participant will be closely monitored by the clinical team throughout the 12-week study period. If a wound heals earlier, the participant will finish the study at that time. If the wound does not heal, the participant may return to their regular physician for follow-up care.",
          "detailedDescription": "This clinical study is a prospective, post-market, proof-of-concept trial evaluating the safety and effectiveness of Miro3D Wound Matrix, a biologically derived, acellular scaffold developed by Reprise Biomedical, in the outpatient treatment of complex wounds and ulcerations. Miro3D is made from porcine liver tissue and processed to retain a porous, three-dimensional structure that provides a supportive environment for tissue regeneration.\n\nThe study investigates Miro3D's real-world impact on wound healing in adult subjects presenting with chronic or complex wounds, including but not limited to diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), pressure ulcers, venous leg ulcers (VLUs), and surgical wound dehiscence (SWD). These types of wounds are often difficult to treat, particularly when they exhibit features like tunneling or undermining. The matrix is applied in conjunction with standard of care (SOC) therapies such as cleansing, offloading, compression, debridement, and the use of secondary dressings.\n\nUp to 20 adult participants will be enrolled at outpatient clinical sites under the supervision of a principal investigator. The study includes both a screening phase and a 12-week treatment phase. There is no run-in or washout period. Eligible subjects are identified based on criteria including wound size (1-40 cm\u00b2), duration, location, vascular perfusion, and willingness to adhere to follow-up and offloading instructions. Subjects with third-degree burns, active untreated osteomyelitis, malignancy, or known porcine allergy, among other conditions, are excluded.\n\nEach subject will receive Miro3D applied weekly for the first four weeks. If healing has not occurred at that point, Miro3D is reapplied every two weeks for up to twelve weeks or until the wound is fully closed. Wound healing is assessed weekly through manual measurements, photographs, and depth probing. The primary study endpoint is percentage area reduction (PAR) and granulation tissue formation at 4 and 12 weeks.\n\nSecondary endpoints include changes from baseline in patient-reported quality of life (QOL) using the Wound-QOL questionnaire, and pain intensity assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS). These questionnaires are completed weekly to gauge the impact of treatment on physical function, emotional wellbeing, pain, odor, and social engagement. In the event of premature withdrawal, efforts are made to gather final QOL and pain assessments.\n\nSubjects attend weekly study visits and may be seen for additional unscheduled visits at the investigator's discretion (e.g., for dressing changes). If the wound heals before 12 weeks, the subject exits the study. If the wound remains open, the subject exits after the final assessment and may return to their standard treating provider.\n\nThe study also closely monitors adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and unanticipated adverse device effects (UADEs). Investigators assess each event's relationship to the study product and report them to the sponsor and IRB as required. All safety data are collected throughout the study and monitored by the study team and sponsor.\n\nThe data collected include subject demographics, medical and surgical history, wound type and size, infection status, tissue characteristics, exudate volume, and treatment regimen. These data are documented in source documents and transcribed into study-specific Case Report Forms (CRFs). Statistical analysis will be performed using summary statistics to evaluate wound closure rates, healing trajectories, and possible correlations between treatment schedule and healing outcomes.\n\nAs a post-market study, this trial does not require an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) and is conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and FDA guidelines. It has been approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB), and informed consent is required from all participants prior to enrollment.\n\nBy evaluating Miro3D in real-world outpatient conditions, this study aims to provide evidence on its ability to promote healing in challenging wounds. The findings may help guide future treatment approaches and inform larger clinical trials focused on specific wound types."

          "briefSummary": "Efforts to find treatments for AD have yielded only modest benefits, likely because longstanding AD pathological processes induce irreversible neurological compromise. These processes begin years before the onset of clinical symptoms. This possibility has been incorporated into a model describing stages of AD development, articulated by the NIA/Alzheimer's Association preclinical workgroup of which the Co-Director of the Kulynych Alzheimer's Research Center, Dr. Suzanne Craft, was a member. According to this model, the best hope for countermanding the effects of AD lies in intervening at the earliest possible point in the pathological cascade. There are several important ongoing efforts in adults with preclinical AD that directly target amyloid aggregation. Although this strategy addresses an important aspect of the AD pathological cascade, we believe that addressing metabolic dysfunction affecting glucose and insulin regulation offers a complementary approach, in that it may reduce amyloid burden and toxicity, while also directly enhancing synaptic health, brain metabolism, tau regulation and neurovascular function.\n\nThe purpose of the ADCC is to identify and characterize early risk factors that predict cognitive decline and dementia in asymptomatic adults and adults with early signs of cognitive impairment. The data obtained from this study, collected at enrollment and follow-up will allow us to examine disease trajectory in individuals with and without prediabetes and other measures of glucoregulatory dysfunction in this process. The enrollees, who will be well-characterized with regard to cognitive and metabolic status through ADCC assessments, will provide an important resource for other local (institution) and national investigations. Data collected from participants enrolled in the ADCC will be stored indefinitely for future investigations.",
          "detailedDescription": "The data and specimen repository of the ADCC study will provide a unified mechanism for cataloging and storing data that can be efficiently shared across studies. This repository will also allow for important collaborations with other Alzheimer's Disease Centers across the US that are performing similar investigations of adults at increased risk of dementia. Data sharing across multiple institutions and investigators will be critical to optimize speed of acquisition and standardization of outcomes that may ultimately lead to the development of innovative tools for early detection and new treatment strategies. The repository will include cognitive data, human specimen samples (blood, cerebrospinal fluid), medical and family history information, and neuroimaging data. Data collected from participants enrolled in the ADCC will be stored indefinitely for future investigations.\n\nParticipants will include adults at least 55 years old, with or without a cognitive deficit, who meet criteria for inclusion into one of the groups described below. Males and females will be equal to distribution in the Triad area population. Additional recruitment efforts targeting underserved communities will be used to increase representation of these adults in the study cohort beyond what is typical in other local and national studies of AD.\n\nEligible participants will have the option to participate in the core ADCC study and also in a biomarker-intensive substudy that will collect additional measurements of brain function and chemical markers of AD pathology. While all participants enrolled in the core ADCC study will receive brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Those enrolled in the substudy will complete a lumbar puncture (LP) to permit quantification of AD biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Participants enrolled in the substudy will be referred to as the Biomarker-Intensive Group, or ADCC-BIG.\n\nAt study entry, participants will meet inclusion criteria for membership in one of the groups that differ according to cognitive status and metabolic health (described below). Once enrolled, a change in cognitive or metabolic status will not affect eligibility to receive follow-up assessments as part of this study, although frequency of assessment may change (i.e., enrollees who progress to late-stage AD or type 2 diabetes will not be dis-enrolled). Eligible participants who choose to also enroll in ADCC-BIG must agree to complete the LP. If participants have screened or participated in another Kulynych Center study within the last 3 months, some data may be reused to avoid redundant data collection and reduce participant burden. This data may include specimen samples such as blood or CSF, cognitive testing data and MRI imaging data."

Continuous blood sugar monitoring has revolutionized type 1 diabetes care but remains underutilized to sustainably support exercise and related behaviors. This remote participation-based research will develop a mobile application that delivers personalized encouragement and data-driven health insights based upon patterns in blood sugar, exercise, mood, and sleep, to assist people with type 1 diabetes in exercising more frequently and confidently. You do not need to live in Connecticut to participate, as there will be no required in-person visits during the study."

The main premise is that obesity leads to reduced brain glucose transport and that we can measure this reduction with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). The secondary premises are that this reduction is driven by elevated non esterified fatty acids which act to turn on specific signaling pathways that regulate brain GLUT1 levels.",
          "detailedDescription": "There are 2 aims of this study. The intent of aim 1 is to measure the effect of obesity on glucose transport and metabolism in the human brain. This study aim will be conducted in non-diabetic, obese individuals and age- and HbA1c-matched normal weight individuals. A total of 15 non-diabetic - normal weight individuals and 15 obese individuals will be enrolled.\n\nThe second aim randomizes 40 non-diabetic, normal weight individuals. The intent of aim 2 is to determine whether acute elevation of NEFA levels in lean, healthy individuals will alter cerebral glucose transport. Eligible participants will be randomized (1:1) to receive either intralipid or normal saline.\n\nThe focus of this protocol registration is the randomized portion of the study (aim 2)."

It can also be a second-degree relative, like nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles, grandchildren, or cousins. A relative of someone with T1D is at a higher risk of getting the disease as they are people with other autoimmune diseases. It is possible to detect T1D or CD before it shows any symptoms of high blood sugar. Sometimes, particularly in people who develop T1D in adult life, the disease is misdiagnosed as type 2 diabetes. The treatment and care for the two diseases are different."
